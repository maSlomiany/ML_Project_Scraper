A member of the Republican Party , he served as the 45th president from 2017 to 2021. Born in New York City, Trump graduated from the University of Pennsylvania in 1968 with a bachelor's degree in economics. He became the president of his family's real estate business in 1971, renamed it the Trump Organization , and began acquiring and building skyscrapers, hotels, casinos, and golf courses. After six business bankruptcies in the 1990s and 2000s, he began side ventures. From 2004 to 2015, he hosted the reality television show The Apprentice . A political outsider, Trump won the 2016 presidential election against Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton . In his first term , Trump imposed a travel ban on citizens from six Muslim-majority countries, expanded the U.S.\u2013Mexico border wall , and implemented a family separation policy . He rolled back environmental and business regulations, signed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, and appointed three Supreme Court justices . In foreign policy, Trump withdrew the U.S. from agreements on climate, trade, and Iran's nuclear program, began a trade war with China , and met with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un without reaching an agreement on denuclearization. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic , he downplayed its severity, contradicted health officials, and signed the CARES Act stimulus. Trump was impeached in 2019 for abuse of power and obstruction of Congress, and in 2021 for incitement of insurrection; the Senate acquitted him in both cases. After his first term, scholars and historians ranked him as one of the worst presidents in American history. Trump is the central figure of Trumpism . Many of his comments and actions have been characterized as racially charged, racist or misogynistic, and he has made false and misleading statements and promoted conspiracy theories to a degree unprecedented in American politics. After losing the 2020 presidential election to Joe Biden , Trump attempted to overturn the outcome , culminating in the January 6 Capitol attack in 2021. In 2023, Trump was held liable in civil cases for sexual abuse and defamation and for business fraud . In 2024, he was found guilty of falsifying business records , making him the first U.S. president convicted of a felony.  After winning the 2024 presidential election against Kamala Harris , Trump was sentenced to a penalty-free discharge , and two other felony indictments against him were dismissed. Trump began his second term by pardoning around 1,500 January\u00a06 rioters , initiating mass layoffs of the federal workforce , and starting a trade war with Mexico and Canada . Trump's broad and extensive use of executive orders has drawn numerous lawsuits challenging their legality. Early life and education Trump at New York Military Academy , 1964 Donald John Trump was born on June\u00a014, 1946, at Jamaica Hospital in the New York City borough of Queens , the fourth child of Fred Trump and Mary Anne MacLeod Trump . [ 1 ] He is of German and Scottish descent. [ 2 ] He grew up with his older siblings, Maryanne , Fred Jr. , and Elizabeth, and his younger brother, Robert , in a mansion in the Jamaica Estates neighborhood of Queens. [ 3 ] Fred Trump paid his children each about $20,000 a year, equivalent to $265,000 a year in 2024. Trump was a millionaire at age eight by contemporary standards. [ a ] [ 4 ] Trump attended the private Kew-Forest School through seventh grade. He was a difficult child and showed an early interest in his father's business. His father enrolled him in New York Military Academy , a private boarding school, to complete secondary school. [ 5 ] Trump considered a show business career but instead in 1964 enrolled at Fordham University . [ 6 ] Two years later, he transferred to the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania , graduating in May 1968 with a Bachelor of Science in economics. [ 7 ] [ 8 ] He was exempted from the draft during the Vietnam War due to a claim of bone spurs in his heels. [ 9 ] Business career Main article: Business career of Donald Trump Further information: Business projects of Donald Trump in Russia and Tax returns of Donald Trump Real estate Starting in 1968, Trump was employed at his father's real estate company, Trump Management, which owned racially segregated middle-class rental housing in New York City's outer boroughs. [ 10 ] [ 11 ] In 1971, his father made him president of the company and he began using the Trump Organization as an umbrella brand . [ 12 ] Roy Cohn was Trump's fixer , lawyer, and mentor [ 13 ] for 13 years in the 1970s and 1980s. [ 14 ] In 1973, Cohn helped Trump countersue the U.S. government for $100\u00a0million (equivalent to $708\u00a0million in 2024) [ 15 ] over its charges that Trump's properties had racial discriminatory practices. Trump's counterclaims were dismissed, and the government's case was settled with the Trumps signing a consent decree agreeing to desegregate; four years later, Trumps were found in contempt of the decree and settled again. [ 16 ] Before age thirty, he showed his propensity for litigation, no matter the outcome and cost; even when he lost, he described the case as a win. [ 17 ] Helping Trump projects, Cohn was a consigliere whose Mafia connections controlled construction unions. [ 18 ] Cohn introduced political consultant Roger Stone to Trump, who enlisted Stone's services to deal with the federal government. [ 19 ] Between 1991 and 2009, he filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection for six of his businesses: the Plaza Hotel in Manhattan, the casinos in Atlantic City, New Jersey , and the Trump Hotels & Casino Resorts company. [ 20 ] [ 21 ] In 1992, Trump, his siblings Maryanne, Elizabeth, and Robert, and his cousin John W. Walter, each with a 20\u00a0percent share, formed All County Building Supply & Maintenance Corp. The company had no offices and is alleged to have been a shell company for paying the vendors providing services and supplies for Trump's rental units, then billing those services and supplies to Trump Management with markups of 20\u201350\u00a0percent and more. The owners shared the proceeds generated by the markups. The increased costs were used to get state approval for increasing the rents of his rent-stabilized units. [ 22 ] Manhattan and Chicago developments Trump in 1985 with a model of one of his aborted Manhattan development projects [ 23 ] Trump attracted public attention in 1978 with the launch of his family's first Manhattan venture: the renovation of the derelict Commodore Hotel , adjacent to Grand Central Terminal. [ 24 ] The financing was facilitated by a $400\u00a0million city property tax abatement arranged for him by his father who also, jointly with Hyatt , guaranteed a $70\u00a0million bank construction loan. [ 11 ] [ 25 ] The hotel reopened in 1980 as the Grand Hyatt Hotel , [ 26 ] and that same year, he obtained rights to develop Trump Tower , a mixed-use skyscraper in Midtown Manhattan. [ 27 ] The building houses the headquarters of the Trump Corporation and Trump's PAC and was his primary residence until 2019. [ 28 ] In 1988, Trump acquired the Plaza Hotel with a loan from a consortium of 16 banks. [ 29 ] The hotel filed for bankruptcy protection in 1992, and a reorganization plan was approved a month later, with the banks taking control of the property. [ 30 ] In 1995, he defaulted on over $3\u00a0billion of bank loans, and the lenders seized the Plaza Hotel along with most of his other properties in a \"vast and humiliating restructuring\" that allowed him to avoid personal bankruptcy. [ 31 ] [ 32 ] The lead bank's attorney said of the banks' decision that they \"all agreed that he'd be better alive than dead\". [ 31 ] In 1996, Trump acquired and renovated the mostly vacant 71-story skyscraper at 40 Wall Street , later rebranded as the Trump Building. [ 33 ] In the early 1990s, he won the right to develop a 70-acre (28\u00a0ha) tract in the Lincoln Square neighborhood near the Hudson River. Struggling with debt from other ventures in 1994, he sold most of his interest in the project to Asian investors, who financed the project's completion, Riverside South . [ 34 ] Trump's last major construction project was the 92-story mixed-use Trump International Hotel and Tower in Chicago which opened in 2008. In 2024, The New York Times and ProPublica reported that the Internal Revenue Service was investigating whether he had twice written off losses incurred through construction cost overruns and lagging sales of residential units in the building he had declared to be worthless on his 2008 tax return. [ 35 ] Atlantic City casinos Entrance of the Trump Taj Mahal in Atlantic City In 1984, Trump opened Harrah's at Trump Plaza , a hotel and casino, with financing and management help from the Holiday Corporation . [ 36 ] It was unprofitable, and he paid Holiday $70\u00a0million in May 1986 to take sole control. [ 37 ] In 1985, he bought the unopened Atlantic City Hilton Hotel and renamed it Trump Castle . [ 38 ] Both casinos filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in 1992. [ 39 ] Trump bought a third Atlantic City venue in 1988, the Trump Taj Mahal . It was financed with $675\u00a0million in junk bonds and completed for $1.1\u00a0billion, opening in April 1990. [ 36 ] He filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in 1991. Under the provisions of the restructuring agreement, he gave up half his initial stake and personally guaranteed future performance. [ 40 ] To reduce his $900\u00a0million of personal debt, he sold the Trump Shuttle airline; his megayacht, the Trump Princess , which had been leased to his casinos and kept docked; and other businesses. [ 41 ] In 1995, Trump founded Trump Hotels & Casino Resorts (THCR), which assumed ownership of the Trump Plaza. [ 42 ] THCR purchased the Taj Mahal and the Trump Castle in 1996 and went bankrupt in 2004 and 2009, leaving him with 10\u00a0percent ownership. [ 36 ] He remained chairman until 2009. [ 43 ] Clubs In 1985, Trump acquired the Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Florida. [ 44 ] In 1995, he converted the estate into a private club with an initiation fee and annual dues.

[ 28 ] He began building and buying golf courses in 1999, owning 17 golf courses by 2016. [ 46 ] Licensing the Trump name See also: List of things named after Donald Trump The Trump Organization often licensed the Trump name for consumer products and services, including foodstuffs, apparel, learning courses, and home furnishings.

[ 49 ] Side ventures Trump and New Jersey Generals quarterback Doug Flutie at a 1985 press conference in Trump Tower In 1970, Trump invested $70,000 to receive billing as coproducer of a Broadway comedy. [ 50 ] In September 1983, he purchased the New Jersey Generals , a team in the United States Football League . After the 1985 season, the league folded, largely due to his attempt to move to a fall schedule (when it would have competed with the National Football League [NFL] for audience) and trying to force a merger with the NFL by bringing an antitrust suit. [ 51 ] Trump and his Plaza Hotel hosted several boxing matches at the Atlantic City Convention Hall . [ 36 ] [ 52 ] In 1989 and 1990, he lent his name to the Tour de Trump cycling stage race, an attempt to create an American equivalent of European races such as the Tour de France or the Giro d'Italia . [ 53 ] From 1986 to 1988, he purchased significant blocks of shares in various public companies while suggesting that he intended to take over the company and then sold his shares for a profit, [ 54 ] leading some observers to think he was engaged in greenmail . [ 55 ] The New York Times found that he initially made millions of dollars in such stock transactions, but \"lost most, if not all, of those gains after investors stopped taking his takeover talk seriously\". [ 54 ] Trump's star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame In 1988, Trump purchased the Eastern Air Lines Shuttle , financing the purchase with $380\u00a0million (equivalent to $1010\u00a0million in 2024) [ 15 ] in loans from a syndicate of 22 banks. He renamed the airline Trump Shuttle and operated it until 1992. [ 56 ] He defaulted on his loans in 1991, and ownership passed to the banks. [ 57 ] In 1996, he purchased the Miss Universe pageants, including Miss USA and Miss Teen USA . [ 58 ] Due to disagreements with CBS about scheduling, he took both pageants to NBC in 2002. [ 59 ] [ 60 ] In 2007, he received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for his work as producer of Miss Universe. [ 61 ] NBC and Univision dropped the pageants in June 2015 in reaction to his comments about Mexican immigrants. [ 62 ] In 2005, Trump cofounded Trump University , a company that sold real estate seminars for up to $35,000. After New York State authorities notified the company that its use of \"university\" violated state law (as it was not an academic institution), its name was changed to the Trump Entrepreneur Initiative in 2010. [ 63 ] In 2013, the State of New York filed a $40\u00a0million civil suit against Trump University, alleging that the company made false statements and defrauded consumers. Additionally, two class actions were filed in federal court against Trump and his companies. Internal documents revealed that employees were instructed to use a hard-sell approach, and former employees testified that Trump University had defrauded or lied to its students. [ 64 ] Shortly after he won the 2016 presidential election, he agreed to pay a total of $25\u00a0million to settle the three cases. [ 65 ] Foundation Main article: Donald J.

After donating a total of $65,000 in 2007\u20132008, he stopped donating any personal funds to the charity, [ 67 ] which received millions from other donors, including $5\u00a0million from Vince McMahon . [ 68 ] The foundation gave to health- and sports-related charities, conservative groups, [ 69 ] and charities that held events at Trump properties. [ 67 ] In 2016, The Washington Post reported that the charity had committed several potential legal and ethical violations, including self-dealing and tax evasion . [ 70 ] Also in 2016, the New York attorney general said the foundation had violated state law by soliciting donations without submitting to required annual external audits and ordered it to cease its fundraising activities in New York immediately. [ 71 ] Trump's team announced in December 2016 that the foundation would be dissolved. [ 72 ] In June 2018, the New York attorney general's office filed a civil suit against the foundation, Trump, and his adult children, seeking $2.8\u00a0million in restitution and additional penalties. [ 73 ] In December 2018, the foundation ceased operation and disbursed its assets to other charities. [ 74 ] In November 2019, a New York state judge ordered Trump to pay $2\u00a0million to a group of charities for misusing the foundation's funds, in part to finance his presidential campaign. [ 75 ] Legal affairs and bankruptcies Main article: Personal and business legal affairs of Donald Trump According to a review of state and federal court files conducted by USA Today in 2018, Trump and his businesses had been involved in more than 4,000 state and federal legal actions.

[ 231 ] One of his central campaign promises was to build a wall along the U.S.\u2013Mexico border ; [ 232 ] during his first term, the U.S. built 73 miles (117\u00a0km) of wall in areas without barriers and 365 miles (587\u00a0km) to replace older barriers. [ 233 ] In 2018, Trump's refusal to sign any congressional spending bill unless it allocated funding for the border wall [ 234 ] resulted in the longest-ever federal government shutdown, for 35 days from December 2018 to January 2019 . [ 235 ] [ 236 ] The shutdown ended after he agreed to fund the government without any funds for the wall. [ 235 ] To avoid another shutdown, Congress passed a funding bill with $1.4\u00a0billion for border fencing in February. [ 237 ] Trump later declared a national emergency on the southern border to divert $6.1\u00a0billion of funding to the border wall [ 237 ] despite congressional disagreement. [ 238 ] In January 2017, Trump signed an executive order that temporarily denied entry to citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries . [ 239 ] [ 240 ] The order caused many protests and legal challenges that resulted in nationwide injunctions . [ 239 ] [ 240 ] [ 241 ] A revised order giving some exceptions was also blocked by courts, [ 242 ] [ 243 ] but the Supreme Court ruled in June that the ban could be enforced on those lacking \"a bona fide relationship with a person or entity\" in the U.S. [ 244 ] Trump replaced the ban in September with a presidential proclamation extending travel bans to North Koreans, Chadians, and some Venezuelan officials, but excluded Iraq and Sudan. [ 245 ] The Supreme Court allowed that version to go into effect in December 2017, [ 246 ] and ultimately upheld the ban in 2019. [ 247 ] From 2017 to 2018, the Trump administration had a policy of family separation that separated over 4,400 children of migrant families from their parents at the U.S.\u2013Mexico border, [ 248 ] [ 249 ] an unprecedented [ 250 ] policy sparked public outrage in the country. [ 251 ] Despite Trump initially blaming Democrats [ 252 ] [ 253 ] and insisting he could not stop the policy with an executive order, he acceded to public pressure in June 2018 and mandated that migrant families be detained together unless \"there is a concern\" of risk for the child. [ 254 ] [ 255 ] A judge later ordered that the families be reunited and further separations stopped except in limited circumstances, [ 256 ] [ 257 ] though over 1,000 additional children were separated from their families after the order.

[ 259 ] He supported populist , neo-nationalist , and authoritarian governments. [ 260 ] Unpredictability, uncertainty, and inconsistency characterized foreign relations during his tenure. [ 259 ] [ 261 ] Relations between the U.S. and its European allies were strained under Trump. [ 262 ] He criticized NATO allies and privately suggested that the U.S. should withdraw from NATO . [ 263 ] [ 264 ] Trump supported many of the policies of Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu . [ 265 ] In 2020, Trump hosted the signing of the Abraham Accords between Israel and the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain to normalize their foreign relations. [ 266 ] Trump began a trade war with China in 2018 after imposing tariffs and other trade barriers he said would force China to end longstanding unfair trade practice and intellectual property theft . [ 267 ] Trump weakened the toughest U.S. sanctions imposed after Russia's 2014 annexation of Crimea . [ 268 ] [ 269 ] Trump praised and, according to some critics, rarely criticized Russian president Vladimir Putin , [ 270 ] [ 271 ] though he opposed some actions of Russia's government. [ 272 ] He withdrew the U.S. from the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty , citing alleged Russian non-compliance, [ 273 ] and supported Russia's possible return to the G7 . [ 274 ] As North Korea's nuclear weapons were increasingly seen as a serious threat, [ 275 ] Trump became the first sitting U.S. president to meet a North Korean leader, meeting Kim Jong Un three times: in Singapore in June 2018, in Hanoi in February 2019, and in the Korean Demilitarized Zone in June 2019. [ 276 ] Talks in October 2019 broke down [ 277 ] and no denuclearization agreement was reached. [ 278 ] Personnel Main articles: Political appointments of the first Trump administration and First cabinet of Donald Trump Trump made his daughter Ivanka and son-in-law Jared Kushner unpaid advisors. [ 279 ] The Trump administration had a high turnover of personnel, particularly among White House staff. By the end of his first year in office, 34\u00a0percent of his original staff had resigned, been fired, or been reassigned. [ 280 ] As of early July\u00a02018 [update] , 61\u00a0percent of his senior aides had left [ 281 ] and 141 staffers had left in the previous year. [ 282 ] Both figures set a record for recent presidents. [ 283 ] Close personal aides to Trump quit or were forced out. [ 284 ] He publicly disparaged several of his former top officials. [ 285 ] Trump had four White House chiefs of staff , marginalizing or pushing out several. [ 286 ] In May 2017, Trump dismissed FBI director James Comey . While initially attributing this action to Comey's conduct in the investigation about Hillary Clinton's emails , Trump said a few days later that he was concerned with Comey's role in the ongoing Trump\u2013Russia investigations. [ 287 ] At a private conversation in February, he said he hoped Comey would drop the investigation into Flynn. [ 288 ] In March and April, he asked Comey to \"lift the cloud impairing his ability to act\" by saying publicly that the FBI was not investigating him. [ 288 ] [ 289 ] Three of Trump's 15 original cabinet members left within his first year. [ 290 ] Health and Human Services secretary Tom Price was forced to resign in September 2017 due to excessive use of private charter jets and military aircraft. [ 290 ] [ 284 ] Environmental Protection Agency administrator Scott Pruitt resigned in 2018 and Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke in January 2019 amid multiple investigations into their conduct. [ 291 ] [ 292 ] Trump was slow to appoint second-tier officials in the executive branch, saying many of the positions are unnecessary. In October 2017, there were hundreds of sub-cabinet positions without a nominee. [ 293 ] By January\u00a08, 2019, of 706 key positions, 433 had been filled and he had no nominee for 264. [ 294 ] Judiciary Further information: List of federal judges appointed by Donald Trump and Donald Trump judicial appointment controversies Trump appointed 226 federal judges , including 54 to the courts of appeals and three to the Supreme Court : Neil Gorsuch , Brett Kavanaugh , and Amy Coney Barrett . [ 295 ] His Supreme Court appointments politically shifted the Court to the right. [ 296 ] [ 297 ] [ 298 ] In the 2016 campaign, he pledged that Roe v. Wade would be overturned \"automatically\" if he were elected and given the opportunity to appoint two or three anti-abortion justices. He later took credit when Roe was overturned by Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization in 2022; all three of his Supreme Court nominees voted with the majority. [ 299 ] [ 300 ] Trump disparaged courts and judges he disagreed with, often in personal terms, and questioned the judiciary's constitutional authority. His attacks on courts drew rebukes from observers, including sitting federal judges, concerned about the effect of his statements on the judicial independence and public confidence in the judiciary. [ 301 ] [ 302 ] COVID-19 pandemic Main article: COVID-19 pandemic in the United States Further information: U.S. federal government response to the COVID-19 pandemic and Communication of the Trump administration during the COVID-19 pandemic See also: Economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States Trump conducts a COVID-19 press briefing with members of the White House Coronavirus Task Force on March\u00a015, 2020. Trump initially ignored public health warnings and calls for action from health officials within his administration and Azar, [ 303 ] focusing on economic and political considerations of the outbreak. [ 304 ] Trump established the White House Coronavirus Task Force on January\u00a029. [ 305 ] Prior to the pandemic, Trump criticized the WHO and other international bodies, which he asserted were taking advantage of U.S. aid. [ 306 ] On March\u00a027, he signed into law the CARES Act \u2014a $2.2\u00a0trillion economic stimulus bill\u2014the largest stimulus in U.S. history. [ 307 ] [ 308 ] In April 2020, Republican-connected groups organized anti-lockdown protests against the measures state governments were taking to combat the pandemic; [ 309 ] [ 310 ] Trump encouraged the protests on Twitter , [ 311 ] although the targeted states did not meet his administration's guidelines for reopening. [ 312 ] He repeatedly pressured federal health agencies to take actions he favored, [ 313 ] such as approving unproven treatments. [ 314 ] [ 315 ] On October\u00a02, 2020, he tweeted that he had tested positive for COVID-19 , part of a White House outbreak. [ 316 ] By July 2020, Trump's handling of the COVID-19 pandemic had become a major issue in the presidential election. [ 317 ] Investigations Further information: Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections , Mueller special counsel investigation , and Mueller report After he assumed office, Trump was the subject of increasing Justice Department and congressional scrutiny, with investigations covering his election campaign, transition, and inauguration, actions taken during his presidency, his private businesses , personal taxes, and charitable foundation . [ 318 ] There were ten federal criminal investigations, eight state and local investigations, and twelve congressional investigations. [ 319 ] In July 2016, the FBI launched Crossfire Hurricane , an investigation into possible links between Russia and Trump's 2016 campaign. [ 320 ] After Trump fired Comey in May 2017, the FBI opened a second investigation into Trump's personal and business dealings with Russia . [ 321 ] In January 2017, three U.S. intelligence agencies jointly stated with \"high confidence\" that Russia interfered in the 2016 presidential election to favor Trump. [ 322 ] [ 323 ] Many suspicious [ 324 ] links between Trump associates and Russian officials were discovered. [ 325 ] [ 326 ] [ 327 ] Trump told Russian officials he was unconcerned about Russia's election interference. [ 328 ] Crossfire Hurricane was later transferred to Robert Mueller 's special counsel investigation ; [ 329 ] the investigation into Trump's ties to Russia was ended by Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein after he told the FBI that Mueller would pursue the matter. [ 330 ] [ 331 ] At the request of Rosenstein, the Mueller investigation examined criminal matters \"in connection with Russia's 2016 election interference\". [ 330 ] Mueller submitted his final report in March 2019. [ 332 ] The report found that Russia did interfere in 2016 to favor Trump [ 333 ] and that Trump and his campaign welcomed and encouraged the effort, [ 334 ] [ 335 ] [ 336 ] but that the evidence \"did not establish\" that Trump campaign members conspired or coordinated with Russia. [ 337 ] [ 338 ] Trump claimed the report exonerated him despite Mueller writing that it did not. [ 339 ] The report also detailed potential obstruction of justice by Trump but \"did not draw ultimate conclusions\" [ 340 ] [ 341 ] and left the decision to charge the laws to Congress. [ 342 ] In April 2019, the House Oversight Committee issued subpoenas seeking financial details from Trump's banks, Deutsche Bank and Capital One , and his accounting firm, Mazars USA . He sued the banks, Mazars, and committee chair Elijah Cummings to prevent the disclosures. [ 343 ] In May, two judges ruled that both Mazars and the banks must comply with the subpoenas; [ 344 ] [ 345 ] [ 346 ] Trump's attorneys appealed. [ 347 ] In September 2022, Trump and the committee agreed to a settlement regarding Mazars, and the firm began turning over documents. [ 348 ] Impeachments Main articles: First impeachment of Donald Trump and Second impeachment of Donald Trump Trump displaying the headline \"Trump acquitted\" in 2019 Trump was impeached twice by the House of Representatives during his first presidential term, though acquitted by the Senate on both occasions. The first impeachment arose from a whistleblower complaint that in 2019 Trump had pressured Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy to investigate Joe and Hunter Biden, [ 349 ] in an attempt to gain an advantage in the 2020 presidential election . [ 350 ] In December 2019, the House voted to impeach Trump for abuse of power and obstruction of Congress , [ 351 ] and the Senate acquitted him in February 2020. [ 352 ] The second impeachment came after the January 6 attack , for which the House charged Trump with incitement of insurrection on January\u00a013, 2021. [ 353 ] Trump left office on January\u00a020, and was acquitted on February\u00a013. [ 354 ] 2020 presidential election Further information: 2020 United States presidential election Presidential campaign Main article: Donald Trump 2020 presidential campaign Trump filed to run for reelection only a few hours after becoming president in 2017. [ 355 ] He held his first reelection rally less than a month after taking office [ 356 ] and officially became the Republican nominee in August 2020. [ 357 ] Trump's campaign focused on crime, claiming that cities would descend into lawlessness if Democratic nominee Joe Biden won. [ 358 ] He repeatedly misrepresented Biden's positions [ 359 ] [ 360 ] and appealed to racism. [ 361 ] Starting in early 2020, Trump sowed doubts about the election, claiming without evidence that it would be rigged and that widespread use of mail balloting would produce massive election fraud. [ 362 ] [ 363 ] He blocked funding for the U.S. Postal Service , saying he wanted to prevent any increase in voting by mail. [ 364 ] He repeatedly refused to say whether he would accept the results if he lost and commit to a peaceful transition of power . [ 365 ] [ 366 ] Loss to Biden and rejection of results Further information: Attempts to overturn the 2020 United States presidential election and 2020\u201321 United States election protests Biden won the November 2020 election, receiving 81.3\u00a0million votes (51.3\u00a0percent) to Trump's 74.2\u00a0million (46.8\u00a0percent) [ 367 ] [ 368 ] and 306 electoral votes to Trump's 232. [ 369 ] The Electoral College formalized Biden's victory on December\u00a014. [ 369 ] Even before the results were known on the morning after the election, Trump declared victory. [ 370 ] Days later, when Biden was projected the winner, Trump baselessly alleged election fraud. [ 371 ] As part of an effort to overturn the results , Trump and his allies filed many legal challenges to the results , which were rejected by at least 86 judges in both state and federal courts for having no factual or legal basis. [ 372 ] [ 373 ] Trump's allegations were also refuted by state election officials, [ 374 ] and the Supreme Court declined to hear a case asking it to overturn the results in four states won by Biden. [ 375 ] Trump repeatedly sought help to overturn the results, personally pressuring Republican local and state office-holders, [ 376 ] Republican legislators, [ 377 ] the Justice Department, [ 378 ] and Vice President Pence, [ 379 ] urging various actions such as replacing presidential electors , or requesting that Georgia officials \"find\" votes and announce a \"recalculated\" result. [ 377 ] In the weeks after the election, Trump withdrew from public activities. [ 380 ] He initially blocked government officials from cooperating in Biden's presidential transition . [ 381 ] [ 382 ] After three weeks, the administrator of the General Services Administration declared Biden the \"apparent winner\" of the election, allowing the disbursement of transition resources to his team. [ 383 ] While Trump said he recommended that the GSA begin transition protocols, he still did not formally concede. [ 384 ] [ 385 ] Trump did not attend Biden's inauguration on January\u00a020. [ 386 ] January 6 Capitol attack Main article: January 6 United States Capitol attack A crowd of Trump supporters during the January 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol in 2021 In December 2020, reports emerged that the U.S. military was on \"red alert\", and ranking officers had discussed what to do if Trump declared martial law . [ 387 ] Joint Chiefs of Staff chairman Mark Milley and CIA director Gina Haspel grew concerned that Trump would attempt a coup or military action against China or Iran. [ 388 ] [ 389 ] Milley insisted that he be consulted about any military orders from Trump, including the use of nuclear weapons. [ 390 ] [ 391 ] At noon on January\u00a06, 2021, while Congress was certifying the presidential election results at the U.S. Capitol, Trump held a rally at the Ellipse in Washington, D.C., where he called for the election to be overturned and urged his supporters to \"fight like hell\" and \"take back our country\" by marching to the Capitol. [ 392 ] His supporters then formed a mob that broke into the building , disrupting certification and causing the evacuation of Congress. [ 393 ] During the attack, Trump posted on social media but did not ask the rioters to disperse until 6\u00a0p.m., when he told them in a tweet to \"go home with love & in peace\" while calling them \"great patriots\" and restating that he had won the election. [ 394 ] Congress later reconvened and confirmed Biden's victory in the early hours of January\u00a07. [ 395 ] More than 140 police officers were injured, and five people died either during or after the attack. [ 396 ] [ 397 ] The event has been described as an attempted self-coup by Trump. [ d ] Between terms (2021\u20132025) See also: Personal and business legal affairs of Donald Trump and Legal affairs of Donald Trump as president Upon leaving the White House, Trump began living at Mar-a-Lago, establishing an office there as provided for by the Former Presidents Act . [ 401 ] His continuing false claims concerning the 2020 election were commonly referred to as the \" big lie \" by his critics, although in May 2021, with his supporters he began using the term to refer to the election itself. [ 402 ] [ 403 ] The Republican Party used his election narrative to justify imposing new voting restrictions in its favor. [ 404 ] [ 405 ] [ 406 ] As of July 2022, he continued to pressure state legislators to overturn the election. [ 407 ] Unlike other former presidents, Trump continued to dominate his party; a 2022 profile in The New York Times described him as a modern party boss . [ 408 ] He continued fundraising, raising a war chest containing more than twice that of the Republican Party, and profited from fundraisers many Republican candidates held at Mar-a-Lago. Much of his focus was on party governance and installing in key posts officials loyal to him. [ 408 ] In the 2022 midterm elections , he endorsed over 200 candidates for various offices. [ 409 ] In February 2021, he registered a new company, Trump Media & Technology Group (TMTG), for providing \"social networking services\" to U.S. customers. [ 410 ] [ 411 ] In March 2024, TMTG merged with special-purpose acquisition company Digital World Acquisition and became a public company . [ 412 ] In February 2022, TMTG launched Truth Social , a social media platform. [ 413 ] In 2019, journalist E. Jean Carroll accused Trump of raping her in the 1990s and sued him for defamation over his denial. [ 414 ] Carroll sued him again in 2022 for battery and more defamation. [ 415 ] He was found liable for sexual abuse and defamation and ordered to pay $5\u00a0million in one case [ 416 ] and $83.3\u00a0million in the other. [ 416 ] [ 417 ] In 2022, New York filed a civil lawsuit was filed against Trump accusing him of inflating the Trump Organization's value to gain an advantage with lenders and banks; [ 418 ] [ 419 ] He was found liable and ordered to pay $350\u00a0million plus interest. [ 419 ] Classified intelligence material found during search of Mar-a-Lago In connection with Trump's efforts to overturn the 2020 election and his involvement in the January\u00a06 attack, in December 2022 the U.S. House committee on the attack recommended criminal charges against him for obstructing an official proceeding , conspiracy to defraud the United States , and inciting or assisting an insurrection. [ 420 ] In August 2023, he was indicted on 13 charges, including racketeering , by a grand jury in Fulton County, Georgia for his efforts to subvert the 2020 election in the state. [ 421 ] [ 422 ] In January 2022, the National Archives and Records Administration retrieved 15 boxes of documents Trump had taken to Mar-a-Lago after leaving the White House, some of which were classified. [ 423 ] In the ensuing Justice Department investigation, officials retrieved more classified documents from his lawyers. [ 423 ] On August\u00a08, 2022, FBI agents searched Mar-a-Lago for illegally held documents, including those in breach of the Espionage Act , collecting 11 sets of classified documents, some marked top secret. [ 424 ] [ 425 ] A federal grand jury constituted by Special Counsel Jack Smith indicted Trump in June 2023 on 31 counts of \"willfully retaining national defense information\" under the Espionage Act , among other charges. [ 423 ] [ 426 ] [ 427 ] Trump pleaded not guilty. [ 428 ] In July 2024, judge Aileen Cannon dismissed the case, ruling Smith's appointment as special prosecutor was unconstitutional. [ 429 ] In May 2024, Trump was convicted on 34 felony counts of falsifying business records . [ 430 ] The case stemmed from evidence that he booked Michael Cohen 's hush-money payments to adult film actress Stormy Daniels as business expenses to cover up his alleged 2006\u20132007 affair with Daniels during the 2016 election. [ 430 ] [ 431 ] On January\u00a010, 2025, the judge gave Trump a no-penalty sentence known as an unconditional discharge, saying that punitive requirements would have interfered with presidential immunity. [ 432 ] After his reelection, the 2020 election obstruction case and the classified documents case were dismissed without prejudice due to Justice Department policy against prosecuting sitting presidents. [ 433 ] 2024 presidential election Main article: Donald Trump 2024 presidential campaign Further information: 2024 Republican Party presidential primaries , 2024 United States presidential election , and Second presidential transition of Donald Trump Trump at a rally in Arizona, August 2024 In November 2022, Trump announced his candidacy for the 2024 presidential election and created a fundraising account. [ 434 ] [ 435 ] In March 2023, the campaign began diverting 10\u00a0percent of the donations to his leadership PAC . His campaign had paid $100\u00a0million towards his legal bills by March 2024. [ 436 ] [ 437 ] In December 2023, the Colorado Supreme Court ruled him disqualified for the Colorado Republican primary for his role in inciting the January\u00a06, 2021, attack on Congress. In March 2024, the U.S. Supreme Court restored his name to the ballot in a unanimous decision, ruling that Colorado lacks the authority to enforce Section 3 of the 14th Amendment , which bars insurrectionists from holding federal office. [ 438 ] During the campaign, Trump made increasingly violent and authoritarian statements. [ 439 ] [ 440 ] [ 441 ] [ 442 ] He said that he would weaponize the FBI and the Justice Department against his political opponents [ 443 ] [ 444 ] and use the military to target Democratic politicians and those that do not support his candidacy. [ 445 ] [ 446 ] He used harsher, more dehumanizing anti-immigrant rhetoric than during his presidency. [ 447 ] [ 448 ] [ 449 ] [ 450 ] His harsher rhetoric against his political enemies has been described by some historians and scholars as authoritarian, fascist , [ e ] and unlike anything a political candidate has ever said in American history. [ 455 ] [ 446 ] [ 456 ] Age and health concerns also arose during the campaign, with several medical experts highlighting an increase in rambling, tangential speech and behavioral disinhibition . [ 457 ] Trump mentioned \"rigged election\" and \"election interference\" earlier and more frequently than in the 2016 and 2020 campaigns and refused to commit to accepting the 2024 election results. [ 458 ] [ 459 ] Analysts for The New York Times described this as an intensification of his \"heads I win; tails you cheated\" rhetorical strategy; the newspaper said the claim of a rigged election had become the backbone of the campaign. [ 459 ] On July\u00a013, 2024, Trump was shot in the ear in an assassination attempt at a campaign rally in Butler Township, Pennsylvania . [ 460 ] [ 461 ] [ 462 ] Two days later, the 2024 Republican National Convention nominated him as their presidential candidate, with Senator JD Vance as his running mate. [ 463 ] In September, he was targeted in another assassination attempt in Florida . [ 464 ] Trump won the election in November 2024 with 312 electoral votes to incumbent vice president Kamala Harris's 226, [ 465 ] making him the second president in U.S. history after Grover Cleveland to be elected to a nonconsecutive second term. [ 466 ] He also won the popular vote with 49.8% to Harris's 48.3%. [ 467 ] His victory in 2024 was part of a global backlash against incumbent parties, [ 468 ] [ 469 ] in part due to the 2021\u20132023 inflation surge . [ 470 ] [ 471 ] Several outlets described his reelection as an extraordinary comeback.

[ 476 ] Early actions, 2025\u2013present See also: Second presidential transition of Donald Trump and First 100 days of the second Donald Trump presidency Upon taking office, Trump signed a series of executive orders that tested the limits of executive authority. Many drew immediate legal challenges. [ 477 ] He issued more executive orders on his first day than any other president. [ 478 ] Four days into his second term, analysis conducted by Time found that nearly two-thirds of his executive actions \"mirror or partially mirror\" proposals from Project 2025 . [ 479 ] He pardoned around 1,500 January\u00a06 rioters , including those who violently attacked police, and commuted the sentences of 14. [ 480 ] In his first weeks, several of his actions have ignored or violated federal laws, regulations, and the Constitution according to American legal scholars. [ 481 ] [ 482 ] [ 483 ] In his administration's first month, Trump issued ninety executive orders, memorandums, and directives. [ 484 ] By March\u00a07, his orders and actions on immigration, firing commissioners and watchdogs, downsizing the federal workforce, and others had been challenged by over 100 lawsuits nationwide. [ 485 ] Mass terminations of federal employees Main article: 2025 United States federal mass layoffs Trump implemented a hiring freeze across the federal government and ordered telework of federal employees to be discontinued within 30 days. [ 486 ] [ 487 ] He ordered a review of many career civil service positions with the intention of reclassifying them into at-will positions without job protections. [ 487 ] [ 488 ] [ 489 ] He initiated mass job terminations of federal employees, [ 490 ] which were described by legal experts as unprecedented or in violation of federal law, [ 491 ] with the intent of replacing them with workers more aligned with his agenda. [ 492 ] By late February, the administration had fired more than 30,000 people. [ 493 ] He ordered an end to diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) projects in the federal government and placed employees in DEI offices on leave. He rescinded Executive Order 11246 , which mandated affirmative action and nondiscrimination practices for federal contractors.

[ 499 ] [ 500 ] He initiated a review of the \"legality and continued applicability\" of the EPA endangerment finding , which is the basis of most federal regulations on greenhouse gases, [ 501 ] and again withdrew the U.S. from the Paris Agreement on climate change. [ 502 ] Trump frequently blamed diversity, equity, and inclusion and wokeness for problems in government and society, and equated diversity with incompetence. [ 503 ] He repealed and reversed pro-diversity policies in the federal government. [ 504 ] [ 505 ] His administration took an aggressive approach against what it called \" gender ideology \", ending the ability to change the gender listed on passports, halting federal funding to entities providing gender-affirming care to people under 19, banning transgender people from the military, and preventing transgender women from competing in women's sports programs at institutions that receive federal funding.

[ 508 ] [ 509 ] The number of illegal crossings had been dropping since early 2024. In February 2025, U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) apprehensions were at the lowest level since monthly data became available in 2000. [ 510 ] [ 511 ] Trump sought to implement mass deportations, with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) setting a goal of 1,200 to 1,500 daily arrests. However, actual numbers of arrests have lagged these goals and the rates of arrests under the Obama and Biden administrations. [ 512 ] [ 513 ] [ 514 ] Trump initially focused deportation operations in sanctuary cities and against individuals on \"target lists\" of criminals formed prior to the Trump administration. Removals were also expedited for asylum applicants who failed to meet requirements. [ 515 ] [ 516 ] [ 517 ] Trump revoked the parole status of migrants who entered the U.S. under CBP One and CHNV humanitarian parole. [ 509 ] [ 517 ] He attempted to remove birthright citizenship and suspend the Refugee Admissions Program . [ 518 ] [ 519 ] On January\u00a029, 2025, he signed the Laken Riley Act into law. [ 520 ] Foreign policy, 2025\u2013present Main article: Foreign policy of the second Donald Trump administration Further information: Second Trump tariffs , 2025 United States trade war with Canada and Mexico , and American expansionism under Donald Trump Trump's second term foreign policy has been described as imperialist and expansionist , [ 521 ] [ 522 ] and continuing an isolationist \" America First \" foreign policy agenda. [ 523 ] His relations with allies were transactional and ranged from indifference to hostility, including threats of annexation. [ 524 ] [ 525 ] He ordered the U.S. government to stop funding and working with the WHO and announced the U.S.'s intention to formally leave the WHO . [ 526 ] [ 527 ] [ 528 ] Trump imposed sweeping tariffs on major trading partners, including China, Canada, and Mexico. [ 529 ] Trump and his incoming administration helped broker a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas alongside the Biden administration, enacted a day prior to his inauguration. [ 530 ] [ 531 ] After making concessions to Putin, he began talks with Russia to end the Russo-Ukrainian war without Ukrainian representatives on February\u00a018. [ 532 ] On February\u00a028, he and Vice President Vance berated Zelenskyy during a televised meeting at the White House. [ 533 ] [ 534 ] Personnel, 2025\u2013present Main articles: Second cabinet of Donald Trump and Political appointments of the second Trump administration In his second term, Trump selected cabinet members with personal loyalty to him, and many appointees lacked relevant experience. [ 535 ] [ 536 ] On February\u00a03, 2025, the White House said that Elon Musk was a special government employee . [ 537 ] Trump gave Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), officially the U.S. DOGE Service Temporary Organization, [ 537 ] access to many federal government agencies. Musk's teams operated in eighteen departments and agencies in the administration's first month, [ 538 ] including in the Treasury Department's $5\u00a0trillion payment system, [ 539 ] the Small Business Administration , the Office of Personnel Management , and the General Services Administration . [ 540 ] Political practice and rhetoric Further information: Trumpism , Political positions of Donald Trump , and Rhetoric of Donald Trump Beginning with his 2016 campaign, Trump's politics and rhetoric led to the creation of a political movement known as Trumpism . [ 541 ] His political positions are populist , [ 542 ] [ 543 ] more specifically described as right-wing populist . [ 544 ] [ 545 ] He helped bring far-right fringe ideas and organizations into the mainstream. [ 546 ] Many of his actions and rhetoric have been described as authoritarian and contributing to democratic backsliding . [ 547 ] [ 548 ] Trump pushed for an expansion of presidential power under a maximalist interpretation of the unitary executive theory . [ 549 ] [ 550 ] His political base has been compared to a cult of personality . [ f ] Trump's rhetoric and actions inflame anger and exacerbate distrust through an \"us\" versus \"them\" narrative. [ 558 ] He explicitly and routinely disparages racial, religious, and ethnic minorities, [ 559 ] and scholars consistently find that racial animus regarding blacks, immigrants, and Muslims are the best predictors of support for Trump. [ 560 ] His rhetoric has been described as using fearmongering and demagogy . [ 561 ] The alt-right movement coalesced around and supported his candidacy, due in part to its opposition to multiculturalism and immigration . [ 562 ] [ 563 ] [ 564 ] He has a strong appeal to evangelical Christian voters and Christian nationalists , [ 565 ] and his rallies take on the symbols, rhetoric, and agenda of Christian nationalism. [ 566 ] Racial and gender views Many of Trump's comments and actions have been described as racist . [ 567 ] In a 2018 national poll, about half of respondents said he is racist; a greater proportion believed that he emboldened racists. [ 568 ] Several studies and surveys found that racist attitudes fueled his political ascent and were more important than economic factors in determining the allegiance of Trump voters. [ 569 ] Racist and Islamophobic attitudes are strong indicators of support for Trump. [ 570 ] He has also been accused of racism for insisting a group of five black and Latino teenagers were guilty of raping a white woman in the 1989 Central Park jogger case , even after they were exonerated in 2002 when the actual rapist confessed and his DNA matched the evidence. In 2024, the men sued Trump for defamation after he said in a televised debate that they had committed the crime and killed the woman. [ 571 ] Trump answering questions about the Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville In 2011, Trump became the leading proponent of the racist \"birther\" conspiracy theory that Barack Obama, the first black U.S. president, was not born in the United States. [ 572 ] He claimed credit for pressuring the government to publish Obama's birth certificate, which he considered fraudulent. [ 573 ] He acknowledged that Obama was born in the U.S. in September 2016, [ 574 ] though reportedly expressed birther views privately in 2017. [ 575 ] During the 2024 presidential campaign, he made false attacks against the racial identity of his opponent, Kamala Harris, that were described as reminiscent of the birther conspiracy theory. [ 576 ] Trump has a history of belittling women when speaking to the media and on social media. [ 577 ] [ 578 ] He made lewd comments, disparaged women's physical appearances, and referred to them using derogatory epithets. [ 578 ] At least 25 women publicly accused him of sexual misconduct , including rape, kissing without consent, groping, looking under women's skirts, and walking in on naked teenage pageant contestants. He has denied the allegations. [ 579 ] In October 2016, a 2005 \" hot mic \" recording surfaced in which he bragged about kissing and groping women without their consent, saying that, \"when you're a star, they let you do it. You can do anything. ... Grab 'em by the pussy .\" [ 580 ] He characterized the comments as \"locker-room talk\". [ 581 ] [ 582 ] The incident's widespread media exposure led to his first public apology, videotaped during his 2016 presidential campaign. [ 583 ] In March 2025 during his presidential address to Congress, Trump endorsed his wife Melania who made her first solo political appearance as first lady for the term by attending a roundtable discussion with Ted Cruz at Capitol Hill on the \"Take It Down Act\", a bill that could speed the removal of deep fake and intimate imagery posted online without an individual\u2019s consent, or revenge porn . [ 584 ] [ 585 ] Link to violence and hate crimes Further information: Rhetoric of Donald Trump \u00a7\u00a0Violence and dehumanization Trump's refusal to condemn the white supremacist Proud Boys during a 2020 presidential debate [ 586 ] and his comment, \"Proud Boys, stand back and stand by\", were attributed to increased recruitment for the pro-Trump group. [ 587 ] Trump has been identified as a key figure in increasing political violence in the U.S., both for and against him. [ 588 ] [ 589 ] [ 590 ] He is described as embracing extremism, conspiracy theories such as Q-Anon , and far-right militia movements to a greater extent than any modern American president, [ 591 ] [ 592 ] and engaging in stochastic terrorism . [ 593 ] [ 594 ] Research suggests Trump's rhetoric is associated with an increased incidence of hate crimes, [ 595 ] [ 596 ] and that he has an emboldening effect on expressing prejudicial attitudes due to his normalization of explicit racial rhetoric. [ 597 ] During his 2016 campaign, he urged or praised physical attacks against protesters or reporters. [ 598 ] [ 599 ] Numerous defendants investigated or prosecuted for violent acts and hate crimes cited his rhetoric in arguing that they were not culpable or should receive leniency. [ 600 ] [ 601 ] A nationwide review by ABC News in May 2020 identified at least 54 criminal cases, from August 2015 to April 2020, in which he was invoked in direct connection with violence or threats of violence mostly by white men and primarily against minorities. [ 602 ] Trump's normalization and revisionist history of the January\u00a06 Capitol attack, and grant of clemency to all January\u00a06 rioters , were described by counterterrorism researchers as encouraging future political violence. [ 603 ] [ 604 ] Conspiracy theories Main article: List of conspiracy theories promoted by Donald Trump Since before his first presidency, Trump has promoted numerous conspiracy theories, including Obama \"birtherism\", global warming being a hoax , and alleged Ukrainian interference in U.S. elections . [ 605 ] [ 606 ] [ 607 ] After the 2020 presidential election, he promoted conspiracy theories for his defeat that were characterized as \" the big lie \". [ 608 ] [ 609 ] False or misleading statements Main article: False or misleading statements by Donald Trump Fact-checkers from The Washington Post , [ 610 ] the Toronto Star , [ 611 ] and CNN [ 612 ] compiled data on \"false or misleading claims\" (orange background), and \"false claims\" (violet foreground), respectively. Trump frequently makes false statements in public remarks [ 613 ] [ 116 ] to an extent unprecedented in American politics . [ 613 ] [ 614 ] [ 615 ] His falsehoods are a distinctive part of his political identity [ 614 ] and have been described as firehosing . [ 616 ] His false and misleading statements were documented by fact-checkers , including at The Washington Post , which tallied 30,573 false or misleading statements made by him during his first presidency, [ 610 ] increasing in frequency over time. [ 617 ] Some of Trump's falsehoods were inconsequential, [ 618 ] [ 619 ] while others had more far-reaching effects, such as his unproven promotion of antimalarial drugs as a treatment for COVID-19, [ 620 ] [ 621 ] causing a U.S. shortage of these drugs and panic-buying in Africa and South Asia. [ 622 ] [ 623 ] Other misinformation, such as misattributing a rise in crime in England and Wales to the \"spread of radical Islamic terror\", served his domestic political purposes. [ 624 ] His attacks on mail-in ballots and other election practices weakened public faith in the integrity of the 2020 presidential election, [ 625 ] [ 626 ] while his disinformation about the pandemic delayed and weakened the national response to it. [ 627 ] [ 628 ] [ 629 ] He habitually does not apologize for his falsehoods. [ 630 ] Until 2018, the media rarely referred to his falsehoods as lies, including when he repeated demonstrably false statements. [ 631 ] [ 632 ] [ 633 ] Social media Main articles: Social media use by Donald Trump and Twitter use by Donald Trump Trump's social media presence attracted worldwide attention after he joined Twitter in 2009. He posted frequently during his 2016 campaign and as president until Twitter banned him after the January\u00a06 attack. [ 634 ] He often used Twitter to communicate directly with the public and sideline the press; [ 635 ] in 2017, his press secretary said that his tweets constituted official presidential statements. [ 636 ] Twitter began attaching fact-checks to tweets in which Trump made false claims in May 2020. [ 637 ] In response, he said social media platforms \"totally silence\" conservatives and he would \"strongly regulate, or close them down\". [ 638 ] After the January\u00a06 attack, he was banned from Facebook , Instagram , Twitter, and other platforms. [ 639 ] The loss of his social media presence diminished his ability to shape events [ 640 ] [ 641 ] and correlated with a dramatic decrease in the volume of misinformation on Twitter. [ 642 ] In February 2022, he launched social media platform Truth Social where he only attracted a fraction of his Twitter following. [ 643 ] Elon Musk , after acquiring Twitter , reinstated his Twitter account in November 2022. [ 644 ] [ 645 ] Meta Platforms ' two-year ban lapsed in January 2023, allowing him to return to Facebook and Instagram, [ 646 ] although in 2024, he continued to call the company an \" enemy of the people \". [ 647 ] In January 2025, Meta agreed to pay $25\u00a0million to settle a 2021 lawsuit filed by Trump over his suspension. [ 648 ] Relationship with the press Further information: First presidency of Donald Trump \u00a7\u00a0Relationship with the news media , and Personal and business legal affairs of Donald Trump Trump talking to the press, March 2017 Trump sought media attention throughout his career, sustaining a \"love-hate\" relationship with the press. [ 649 ] In the 2016 campaign, he benefited from a record amount of free media coverage. [ 650 ] The New York Times writer Amy Chozick wrote in 2018 that his media dominance enthralled the public and created \"must-see TV\". [ 651 ] As a candidate and as president, he frequently accused the press of bias, calling it the \"fake news media\" and \"the enemy of the people \". [ 652 ] In 2018, journalist Lesley Stahl said that he had privately told her that he intentionally discredited the media \"so when you write negative stories about me no one will believe you\". [ 653 ] The first Trump presidency reduced formal press briefings from about one hundred in 2017 to about half that in 2018 and to two in 2019; they also revoked the press passes of two White House reporters, which were restored by the courts. [ 654 ] Trump's 2020 presidential campaign sued The New York Times , The Washington Post , and CNN for defamation in opinion pieces about his stance on Russian election interference. All the suits were dismissed. [ 655 ] [ 656 ] By 2024, he repeatedly voiced support for outlawing political dissent and criticism, [ 657 ] and said that reporters should be prosecuted for not divulging confidential sources and media companies should possibly lose their broadcast licenses for unfavorable coverage of him. [ 658 ] In 2024, he sued ABC News for defamation after George Stephanopoulos said on-air that a jury had found him civilly liable for raping E. Jean Carroll. The case was settled in December with ABC's parent company, Walt Disney , apologizing for the inaccurate claims about Trump and agreeing to donate $15\u00a0million to his future presidential library.

[ 663 ] He and Maples married in 1993 and divorced in 1999. They have one daughter, Tiffany (b. 1993), whom Maples raised in California. [ 664 ] In 2005, he married Slovenian model Melania Knauss . [ 665 ] They have one son, Barron (b. 2006). [ 666 ] Health Main article: Age and health concerns about Donald Trump Trump says he has never drunk alcohol, smoked cigarettes, or used drugs. [ 667 ] [ 668 ] He sleeps about four or five hours a night. [ 669 ] [ 670 ] He has called golfing his \"primary form of exercise\", but usually does not walk the course. [ 671 ] He considers exercise a waste of energy because he believes the body is \"like a battery, with a finite amount of energy\", which is depleted by exercise. [ 672 ] [ 673 ] In 2015, his campaign released a letter from his longtime personal physician, Harold Bornstein , stating that he would \"be the healthiest individual ever elected to the presidency\". [ 674 ] In 2018, Bornstein said Trump had dictated the contents of the letter and that three of Trump's agents had seized his medical records in a February 2017 raid on Bornstein's office. [ 674 ] [ 675 ] Religion Main article: Donald Trump and religion Trump declared that he was a Presbyterian and a Protestant in 2016, [ 676 ] [ 677 ] though in 2020, he began to identify as a nondenominational Christian .

[ 680 ] By mid-2020, 16\u00a0percent of international respondents to a 13-nation Pew Research poll expressed confidence in Trump, lower than China's Xi Jinping and Russia's Vladimir Putin . [ 681 ] During his first presidency, research from 2020 found that Trump had a stronger impact on popular assessments towards American political parties and partisan opinions than any president since Harry S. Truman . [ 682 ] In 2021, he was identified as the only president never to reach a 50\u00a0percent approval rating in the Gallup poll, which dates to 1938, partially due to a record-high partisan gap in his approval ratings: 88\u00a0percent among Republicans and 7\u00a0percent among Democrats. [ 683 ] His early ratings were unusually stable, ranging between 35 and 49\u00a0percent. [ 684 ] He finished his term with a rating between 29 and 34\u00a0percent\u2014the lowest of any president since modern polling began\u2014and a record-low average of 41\u00a0percent throughout his presidency. [ 683 ] [ 685 ] In Gallup's annual poll asking Americans to name the man they admire the most, Trump placed second to Obama in 2017 and 2018, tied with Obama for first in 2019, and placed first in 2020. [ 686 ] [ 687 ] Since Gallup started conducting the poll in 1946, he was the first elected president not to be named most admired in his first year in office. [ 688 ] According to Gallup, Trump began his second term with an approval rating of 47% and a disapproval rating of 48%. His approval rating was extremely politically polarized, being approved by 91% of Republicans, 46% of independents, and 6% of Democrats.

He rated lowest in the leadership characteristics categories for moral authority and administrative skills. [ 691 ] [ 692 ] The Siena College Research Institute 's 2022 survey ranked him third-worst. He was ranked near the bottom in all categories except for luck, willingness to take risks, and party leadership, and ranked last in several categories. [ 693 ] In 2018 and 2024, members of the American Political Science Association ranked him the worst president. [ 694 ] [ 695 ] See also Awards and honors received by Donald Trump Pseudonyms used by Donald Trump Notes ^ Beginning when Trump was three years old, his father gave each of his children $6,000 every year, the maximum allowed without incurring a gift tax.

Trump The White House Search News Administration Issues Contact Visit X Instagram Facebook Search for: Press Enter to Search Administration Donald J. Trump 45th & 47th President of the United States After a landslide election victory in 2024, President Donald J. Trump is returning to the White House to build upon his previous successes and use his mandate to reject the extremist policies of the radical left while providing tangible quality of life improvements for the American people. This includes putting a stop to endless wars, defending our nation\u2019s borders, and unleashing the potential of the American economy, affording ALL Americans the opportunity to pursue THEIR version of the American dream. In his first administration, President Trump passed record-setting tax cuts and regulation cuts, achieved energy independence, replaced NAFTA with the United-States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, invested $2 trillion to completely rebuild the Military, launched the Space Force, obliterated the ISIS Caliphate, achieved a major breakthrough for peace in the Middle East, passed the most significant Veterans Affairs reforms in half a century, confirmed over 250 federal judges, including 3 Supreme Court Justices, signed bipartisan Criminal Justice Reform, lowered drug prices, protected Medicare and Social Security, and secured our nation\u2019s borders in his first four years in office.\u00a0 This was only the beginning. Donald J. Trump defines the American success story. Throughout his life he has continually set the standards of business and entrepreneurial excellence, especially in real estate, sports, and entertainment. President Trump built on his success in private life when he entered into politics and public service. He remarkably won the Presidency in his first ever run for any political office.\u00a0 He won a second time despite several assassination attempts and the unprecedented weaponization of law fare against him.\u00a0 Time after time President Trump has defied the odds because he fundamentally believes in the exceptionalism of the American spirit and wants to see our great country succeed. A graduate of the University of Pennsylvania\u2019s Wharton School of Finance, President Trump followed in his father\u2019s footsteps into the world of real estate development, making his mark in New York City. There, the Trump name soon became synonymous with the most prestigious of addresses in Manhattan and, subsequently, throughout the world. President Trump is also an accomplished author. He has written more than fourteen bestsellers. His first book, The Art of the Deal, is considered a business classic. President Trump has five children, Barron, Don Jr., Ivanka, Eric, and Tiffany, as well as 10 grandchildren. Learn more about First Lady Melania Trump here.

Following in his father\u2019s footsteps, Trump began a notable career as a real estate developer and businessman. He has written more than fourteen books. His first book, The Art of the Deal , was published in 1987. From 2004 to 2015, Trump hosted and produced the popular television show, The Apprentice . President Trump married his wife, Melania, in 2005. Together they have one son, Barron. Trump also has four adult children, Donald Jr., Ivanka, Eric, and Tiffany. He has 10 grandchildren.

On November 8, 2016, Trump was elected to his first term as President, defeating former First Lady and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. He was inaugurated as the 45th President of the United States on January 20, 2017. The work of the first Trump Administration included reforming the U.S. tax code; renegotiating trade agreements with Mexico, Canada, China, Japan, and South Korea; expanding the military; defeating the self-proclaimed Islamic State (ISIS); responding to the opioid crisis; improving access to healthcare for veterans; responding to the COVID-19 global pandemic and supporting vaccine development; and lowering the cost of prescription drugs. President Trump nominated three Supreme Court justices; Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh, and Amy Coney Barrett; the most nominated and confirmed by any one-term president since Herbert Hoover. His administration\u2019s priority for appointing Federal judges was demonstrated by the appointment of over 200 judges during his first term in office. In 2019 President Trump was impeached by the U.S. House of Representatives for abuse of power by soliciting the interference of Ukraine in the 2020 U.S. presidential election and obstruction of Congress by directing defiance of certain subpoenas issued by the House of Representatives.

The S&P 500, which tracks the biggest American companies, fell about 2% in early trade, while the Dow Jones dropped 0.9% and the Nasdaq sank more than 3.5%. The falls came after President Donald Trump ducked questions about whether the US economy was facing a recession or price rises as a result of tariff moves, while warning instead of a \"period of transition\". Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, however, insisted there would be no contraction in the US, although he acknowledged that the price of some goods may rise. Investors fear that tariffs - which are taxes on goods applied as they enter the country - will lead to higher prices and ultimately dent growth in the world's largest economy. \"The level of tariffs that Trump is imposing, I think no doubt, will have to cause inflation somewhere down the line,\" Rachel Winter, investment manager at Killik & Co, told the Today programme. Economist Mohamed El-Erian said investors had been optimistic about Trump's plans for de-regulation and lower taxes, while under-estimating the likelihood of a trade war. He said the recent falls in the stock market, which started last week, reflect the adjustment of those bets. \"It's a complete change in what the market expected,\" he added, noting that investors are also responding to signs that businesses and households are starting to hold off on spending amid the uncertainty, which could hurt economic growth. European stocks closed lower on Monday, with France's CAC and the London FTSE indices both closing around 0.9% lower. Germany's DAX closed 1.75% lower. Susannah Streeter, head of money and markets at the stockbrokers, Hargreaves Lansdown said it was because of \"unease around the impact of Trump tariffs\". She added that concerns over the US economy entering a recession is worrying investors. Tesla shares fell about 8% on Monday, while tech stocks Nvidia and Meta were both down more than 4%. Speaking to Fox News in an interview broadcast on Sunday but recorded on Thursday, Trump appeared to acknowledge the concerns, responding to a question about whether the US was facing recession: \"I hate to predict things like that. There is a period of transition because what we're doing is very big. We're bringing wealth back to America. That's a big thing.\" \"It takes a little time, but I think it should be great for us,\" he added. Watch: Trump says tariff exemptions not influenced by the markets The US president has accused China, Mexico and Canada of not doing enough to end the flow of illegal drugs and migrants into the US. The three countries have rejected the accusations. He imposed new 25% tariffs on imports from Mexico and Canada last week, but then exempted many of those goods just two days later. Trump also doubled a blanket tariff on goods from China to 20%. The US is now facing retaliation, including new tit-for-tat tariffs from China targeting US farm products that came into effect on Monday. They mean US exports including chicken, beef, pork, wheat, and soybeans face new tariffs of 10% to 15%. Ontario premier Doug Ford, who leads Canada's most populous province, also said he was going forward with a 25% surcharge on energy exports to the US, announced in retaliation for the tariffs. If Trump escalates, \"I will not hesitate to shut the electricity off completely,\" he warned. Trump expands exemptions from Canada and Mexico tariffs Bourbon is out, patriotism is in - How Canadians are facing Trump threats head on China retaliates against US tariffs - but it also wants to talk Trump team hits pause on tariffs - but still sees them as vital tool Speaking on NBC on Sunday, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick acknowledged: \"Foreign goods may get a little more expensive\". \"But American goods are going to get cheaper,\" he said. But when asked whether the US economy could face a recession he added: \"Absolutely not\u2026 There's going to be no recession in America.\" Former US Commerce Department official, Frank Lavin, told the BBC that he thinks the trade war is unlikely to escalate out of control. But while tariffs will eventually \"fade a bit\" they will still be an \"extra burden on the US economy,\" he said. Han Shen Lin, China country director at consultancy firm The Asia Group, told the BBC's Today programme: \"You're seeing a lot of tit for tat between both sides to demonstrate that neither side will back off easily. \"That said China has realised it probably can't export its way to GDP growth in the way that it used to so it is focusing a lot more on the domestic economy right now.\" International Business Trump tariffs Trade war Related Software bug at firm left NHS data 'vulnerable to hackers' 16 hrs ago Technology Luxury lounges: Credit card perks 'we are all paying for' 18 hrs ago Business 'A pig in lipstick': Trump's strategic Bitcoin reserve criticised 3 days ago Business More 9 mins ago Ontario says it will slap a 25% surcharge on US-bound electricity The move is in retaliation to Trump's tariff threats on Canada, and is expected to raise energy costs for 1.5 million US homes. 9 mins ago US & Canada 1 hr ago Ontario premier: Tariffs could add $100 to US electricity bills Doug Ford announced a 25% surcharge on electricity affecting 1.5 million homes and businesses across Minnesota, Michigan and New York. 1 hr ago US & Canada 9 hrs ago The 'anti-Trump' numbers man who may force the UK to take a side The incoming Canadian PM has made standing up to his US counterpart a big part of his campaign. 9 hrs ago Business 1 day ago How Trump's threats have changed everything about Canada's politics Justin Trudeau's party was headed for near-certain defeat - until the US president said he wanted to make Canada the 51st state. 1 day ago US & Canada 3 days ago Bourbon is out, patriotism is in - How Canadians are facing Trump threats head on Across the country, Canadians are defiant in boycotting American goods and travel even as Trump promises another temporary reprieve. 3 days ago US & Canada British Broadcasting Corporation Home News Sport Business Innovation Culture Arts Travel Earth Audio Video Live Weather BBC Shop BBC in other languages Follow BBC on: Terms of Use About the BBC Privacy Policy Cookies Accessibility Help Contact the BBC Advertise with us Do not share or sell my info Contact technical support Copyright 2025 BBC.

Trump Official White House Photo by Shealah Craighead Donald John Trump was born in Queens, New York, on June 14, 1946. His father, Fred Trump was a successful real estate developer. Trump was educated at the New York Military Academy and the Wharton School of Finance and Commerce at the University of Pennsylvania. In 1971, he took over his father\u2019s real estate company, renaming it the Trump Organization. The business soon became involved in variety of projects, including hotels, resorts, residential and commercial building, casinos, and golf courses. His first of many books was The Art of the Deal , published in 1987. In 2004, he launched the reality television show The Apprentice . In 2005, Donald Trump married Melania Knauss. They have one son, Barron. Trump also has four adult children from previous marriages: Donald Jr., Ivanka, Eric, and Tiffany. During the 2016 primary, Trump defeated more than a dozen rivals to win the Republican nomination. While he lost the popular vote, Trump defeated former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in the general election by winning a majority of Electoral College votes. His campaign slogan was \u201cMake America Great Again.\u201d Without previous elected political experience, President Trump used unconventional methods to communicate his priorities. Most notably, he used the social media platform Twitter as a primary mechanism for direct communication with the American public, other politicians, and the press corps. As president, he signed a major tax reform bill into law and oversaw a reduction of federal regulations. His protectionist trade policies included tariffs in foreign aluminum, steel, and other products. The Trump administration also renegotiated trade agreements with Mexico, Canada, China, Japan, and South Korea. Other domestic priorities included Supreme Court and federal judiciary appointments, increased military budgets, aggressive border and immigration control, criminal justice reform, and the reduction of prescription drug prices. In foreign policy, the Trump administration moved the U.S. Embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem and brokered normalization agreements between Israel and a number of countries. In 2018, President Trump attended a summit with Kim Jong Un, marking the first time a sitting president met with a North Korean leader. In 2018, there was a partial government shutdown as Trump disagreed with Congress over funding for a border wall between the United States and Mexico. The funding lapse lasted thirty-five days before it was resolved. In 2019, a federal whistleblower filed a complaint that Trump had pressured Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden\u2019s son Hunter, who had served on the board of Bursima Holdings, a natural gas company in Ukraine. Later that year, the House of Representatives impeached President Trump based upon allegations of obstruction of Congress and abuse of power. In 2020, the Senate acquitted Trump on both articles of impeachment. The first confirmed case of COVID-19 was reported in the United States on January 20, 2020. The remainder of Trump\u2019s presidency was consumed with the coronavirus pandemic. Critics argued that Trump\u2019s response to the pandemic was delayed and did not sufficiently encourage public health practices to reduce the spread of the virus. However, the Trump administration\u2019s program \u201cOperation Warp Speed\u201d assisted in the private sector development of two approved vaccines. Trump lost reelection to Democratic candidate Joe Biden, but publicly claimed widespread voter fraud had affected the outcome. Supporters of President Trump traveled to Washington, D.C. for a \u201cSave America\u201d rally on January 6, 2021. Trump spoke to the large crowd on the Ellipse near the White House and encouraged attendees to protest the counting of the Electoral College votes in Congress. The rally turned violent when the president\u2019s supporters overwhelmed law enforcement, breaching the United States Capitol and disrupting the vote count. According to a bipartisan Senate report, \"seven individuals, including three law enforcement officers, ultimately lost their lives\" and the Capitol complex suffered millions of dollars in damage. 1 On January 13, 2021, the House of Representatives approved one article of impeachment \u2013 \u201cincitement of insurrection.\u201d He is the only president in American history to be impeached and acquitted twice by Congress. In November 2022, Trump announced his candidacy and won the Republican nomination handily. He campaigned on immigration and tax reform, tariffs to stimulate American manufacturing, and reducing federal regulations and agencies. In 2024, he defeated Vice President Kamala Harris, winning 312 electoral votes and a plurality of the popular vote.

US President Donald Trump's repeated interest in acquiring Greenland has put it firmly in the spotlight and fuelled the longstanding debate on the island's future ties with Copenhagen. \"There's never been a spotlight like this on Greenland before,\" says Nauja Bianco, a Danish-Greenlandic policy expert on the Arctic. Greenland has been controlled by Denmark \u2013 nearly 3,000km (1,860 miles) away \u2013 for about 300 years. It governs its own domestic affairs, but decisions on foreign and defence policy are made in Copenhagen. Now, five out of six parties on the ballot favour Greenland's independence from Denmark, differing only on how quickly that should come about. The debate over independence has been \"put on steroids by Trump\", says Masaana Egede, editor of Greenlandic newspaper Sermitsiaq. The island's strategic location and untapped mineral resources have caught the US president's eye. He first floated the idea of buying Greenland back during his first term in 2019. Since taking office again in January, he has reiterated his intention to acquire the territory. Greenland and Denmark's leaders have repeatedly rebuffed his demands. Addressing the US Congress last week, however, Trump again doubled down. \"We need Greenland for national security. One way or the other we're gonna get it,\" he said, prompting applause and laughter from a number of politicians, including Vice-President JD Vance. Reuters Donald Trump again said he wanted the US to get Greenland \"one way or another\" in his Congress address last week In Nuuk, his words struck a nerve with politicians who were quick to condemn them. \"We deserve to be treated with respect and I don't think the American president has done that lately since he took office,\" Prime Minister Mute Egede said. Still, the US interest has stoked calls for Greenland to break away from Denmark, with much of the debate focused on when \u2013 not if \u2013 the process of independence should begin. Greenland's independence goal is not new, Nauja Bianco points out, and has been decades in the making. A string of revelations about past mistreatment of Inuit people by the Danes have hurt Greenlandic public opinion about Denmark. Earlier this year, PM Egede said the territory should free itself from \"the shackles of colonialism\". But it is the first time the subject has taken centre stage in an election. Getty Images Prime Minister Mute Egede, right, is pushing for a more gradual transition towards autonomy for Greenland Inuit Ataqatigiit (IA), the party of Prime Minister Mute Egede, favours gradual steps towards autonomy. \"Citizens must feel secure,\" he told local media. Arctic expert Martin Breum says Egede's handling of the challenge from Trump and strong words against Denmark over past colonial wrongdoings \"will give him a lot of votes\". Smaller rivals could also gain ground and potentially shake up alliances. Opposition party Naleraq wants to immediately kick-off divorce proceedings from Copenhagen and have closer defence dealings with Washington. Pointing to Greenland's EU departure and Brexit, party leader Pele Broberg has said that Greenland could be \"out of the Danish kingdom in three years\". Naleraq is fielding the largest number of candidates and has gained momentum by riding the wave of discontent with Denmark. \"Naleraq will also be a larger factor too in parliament,\" predicts Mr Breum, who says party candidates have performed well on TV and on social media. However, the centre-right Demokraatit party believes it is too soon to push for independence. \"The economy will have to be much stronger than it is today,\" party candidate Justus Hansen told Reuters. Greenland's economy is driven by fishing, and government spending relies on annual subsidies from Denmark. They lost 52 soldiers fighting alongside the US. Now they feel threatened by Trump Inside the race for Greenland's mineral wealth Why does Trump want Greenland and what do its people think? Talk of Trump and independence has overshadowed other key issues for voters, says newspaper editor Masaana Egede. \"It's an election where we should be talking about healthcare, care of the elderly and social problems. Almost everything is about independence.\" According to recent polls, almost 80% of Greenlanders back moves towards future statehood. About 44,000 people are eligible to vote, and given the low numbers and few polls, results are difficult to forecast. Even though a majority of Greenlanders favour independence, a survey has shown that half would be less enthusiastic about independence if that meant lower living standards. One poll found that 85% of Greenlanders do not wish to become a part of the United States, and nearly half see Trump's interest as a threat. EPA Tensions between Greenland and Denmark have been heightened over past mistreatment of Inuit people by the Danes One fear among some Greenlanders, says Masaana Egede, is how long the Arctic island could remain independent and whether it would break off from Denmark only to have another country \"standing on our coasts and start taking over\". Experts say it is this worry that could steer votes towards keeping the status quo. Although Greenland's right to self-determination is enshrined into law by the 2009 Self-Rule Act, there are several steps to take before the territory could break away from Denmark, including holding a referendum. This means getting full independence could take \"about 10 to 15 years,\" says Kaj Kleist, a veteran Greenlandic politician and civil servant who prepared the Self-Rule Act. \"There is lot of preparation and negotiations with the Danish government before you can make that a reality,\" he adds. Whatever the election's outcome, experts do not believe Greenland could become independent before Trump's second term is over in 2028. The results are expected in the early hours of Wednesday.

By the time he left office after losing the 2020 presidential election to former Vice President Joe Biden, Trump\u2019s first term was largely defined by scandal, investigation, and intense partisan division. Both supporters and critics often used the word \u201cunprecedented\u201d to describe his time in office. The historically unusual nature of his presidency was confirmed four years later when he became the second person ever, and the first since the 19th century, elected to two non-consecutive terms. He took the oath of office for the second time on January 20, 2025.

Following his inauguration on January 20, 2025, Trump became only the second president to serve two nonconsecutive terms, the first being Grover Cleveland (1885\u201389; 1893\u201397). In January 2025, upon his sentencing without punishment for a felony conviction in 2024, Trump officially became the first convicted felon to be elected president. At age 78, Trump is the oldest person to win the office. Trump\u2019s conviction took place on May 30, 2024, when a New York state jury found him guilty on 34 felony counts of falsifying business records in connection with a hush-money payment in 2016 to the adult-film star Stephanie Clifford, known as Stormy Daniels, who claimed to have had an affair with Trump in 2006. He had also been indicted on dozens of other federal and state charges in cases relating to his efforts to overturn his defeat in the presidential election of 2020 and his removal of numerous classified documents from the White House upon leaving office. Following Trump\u2019s election to a second term, special counsel Jack Smith , who led both federal criminal cases against Trump, requested that the election-related charges against Trump be dropped and that Trump be removed from the group of codefendants in the classified documents case. Smith\u2019s decisions reflected a Justice Department policy that prohibits the criminal prosecution of a sitting president. Trump was also found liable in a major civil suit alleging business fraud in New York state and in two civil suits accusing him of sexually abusing and defaming the writer E. Jean Carroll. Donald Trump Donald Trump was the 45th president of the United States. During his presidency he became the only president to be impeached twice. (more) Trump is the third president in U.S. history (after Andrew Johnson in 1868 and Bill Clinton in 1998) to be impeached by the U.S. House of Representatives and the only president to be impeached twice\u2014once (in 2019) for abuse of power and obstruction of Congress in connection with the Ukraine scandal and once (in 2021) for \u201cincitement of insurrection\u201d in connection with the January 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol by a violent mob of Trump supporters. Both of Trump\u2019s impeachments ended in his acquittal by the U.S. Senate . After the midterm elections of 2022, Trump declared his intention to run for a second term, and in primary elections in early 2024 he accumulated enough delegates to win his party\u2019s nomination, despite the steady progress of the legal cases against him. Although some Republican Party leaders worried that a criminal trial could seriously weaken Trump\u2019s appeal to moderate Republican and independent voters, others took the hopeful view that Trump would use his court appearances to solidify his support by casting himself as a political martyr\u2014the victim of Democratic -led \u201cwitch hunts,\u201d \u201choaxes,\u201d and \u201cscams,\u201d as he frequently characterized the many legal investigations he faced. Britannica Quiz U.S. Presidents and Their Years in Office Quiz Trump is also a real estate developer and businessman who has owned, managed, or licensed his name to hotels , casinos , golf courses, resorts, and residential properties in the New York City area and around the world. Since the 1980s Trump has lent his name to scores of retail ventures\u2014including branded lines of clothing, cologne, food, and furniture . In the early 21st century his private conglomerate , the Trump Organization , comprised some 500 companies involved in a wide range of businesses, including hotels and resorts, residential properties, merchandise, and entertainment and television . Early life and business career Donald Trump Donald Trump speaking in front of Trump Tower, New York City, August 2008. (more) Trump was the fourth of five children of Frederick (Fred) Christ Trump, a successful real estate developer, and Mary MacLeod. Donald\u2019s eldest sister, Maryanne Trump Barry, eventually served as a U.S. district court judge (1983\u201399) and later as a judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit until her retirement in 2011. His elder brother, Frederick, Jr. (Freddy), worked briefly for their father\u2019s business before becoming an airline pilot in the 1960s. Freddy\u2019s alcoholism led to his early death in 1981, at the age of 43. Get Unlimited Access Try Britannica Premium for free and discover more. Subscribe Beginning in the late 1920s, Fred Trump built hundreds of single-family houses and row houses in the Queens and Brooklyn boroughs of New York City, and from the late 1940s he built thousands of apartment units, mostly in Brooklyn, using federal loan guarantees designed to stimulate the construction of affordable housing . During World War II he also built federally backed housing for naval personnel and shipyard workers in Virginia and Pennsylvania . In 1954 Fred was investigated by the Senate Banking Committee for allegedly abusing the loan-guarantee program by deliberately overestimating the costs of his construction projects to secure larger loans from commercial banks , enabling him to keep the difference between the loan amounts and his actual construction costs. In testimony before the Senate committee in 1954, Fred admitted that he had built the Beach Haven apartment complex in Brooklyn for $3.7 million less than the amount of his government-insured loan. Although he was not charged with any crime, he was thereafter unable to obtain federal loan guarantees. A decade later a New York state investigation found that Fred had used his profit on a state-insured construction loan to build a shopping center that was entirely his own property. He eventually returned $1.2 million to the state but was thereafter unable to obtain state loan guarantees for residential projects in the Coney Island area of Brooklyn. Donald Trump attended New York Military Academy (1959\u201364), a private boarding school; Fordham University in the Bronx (1964\u201366); and the University of Pennsylvania \u2019s Wharton School of Finance and Commerce (1966\u201368), where he graduated with a bachelor\u2019s degree in economics . In 1968, during the Vietnam War , he secured a diagnosis of bone spurs, which qualified him for a medical exemption from the military draft (he had earlier received four draft deferments for education). Upon his graduation Trump began working full-time for his father\u2019s business, helping to manage its holdings of rental housing, then estimated at between 10,000 and 22,000 units. In 1974 he became president of a conglomeration of Trump-owned corporations and partnerships, which he later named the Trump Organization. During the 1960s and early 1970s, Trump-owned housing developments in New York City, Cincinnati , Ohio , and Norfolk , Virginia , were the target of several complaints of racial discrimination against African Americans and other minority groups. In 1973 Fred and Donald Trump, along with their company, were sued by the U.S. Justice Department for allegedly violating the Fair Housing Act (1968) in the operation of 39 apartment buildings in New York City. The Trumps initially countersued the Justice Department for $100 million, alleging harm to their reputations. The suit was settled two years later under an agreement that did not require the Trumps to admit guilt. In the late 1970s and the 1980s, Donald Trump greatly expanded his father\u2019s business by investing in luxury hotels and residential properties and by shifting its geographic focus to Manhattan and later to Atlantic City , New Jersey . In doing so, he relied heavily on loans, gifts, and other financial assistance from his father, as well as on his father\u2019s political connections in New York City. In 1976 he purchased the decrepit Commodore Hotel near Grand Central Station under a complex profit-sharing agreement with the city that included a 40-year property tax abatement, the first such tax break granted to a commercial property in New York City. Relying on a construction loan guaranteed by his father and the Hyatt Corporation, which became a partner in the project, Trump refurbished the building and reopened it in 1980 as the 1,400-room Grand Hyatt Hotel. In 1983 he opened Trump Tower , an office, retail, and residential complex constructed in partnership with the Equitable Life Assurance Company. The 58-story building on 56th Street and Fifth Avenue eventually contained Trump\u2019s Manhattan residence and the headquarters of the Trump Organization. Other Manhattan properties developed by Trump during the 1980s include the Trump Plaza residential cooperative (1984), the Trump Parc luxury condominium complex (1986), and the 19-story Plaza Hotel (1988), a historic landmark for which Trump paid more than $400 million. In the 1980s Trump invested heavily in the casino business in Atlantic City, where his properties eventually included Harrah\u2019s at Trump Plaza (1984, later renamed Trump Plaza), Trump\u2019s Castle Casino Resort (1985), and the Trump Taj Mahal (1990), then the largest casino in the world. During that period Trump also purchased the New Jersey Generals, a team in the short-lived U.S. Football League; Mar-a-Lago , a 118-room mansion in Palm Beach , Florida, built in the 1920s by the cereal heiress Marjorie Merriweather Post; a 282-foot yacht , then the world\u2019s second largest, which he named the Trump Princess ; and an East Coast air-shuttle service, which he called Trump Shuttle. In 1977 Trump married Ivana Zeln\u00ed\u010dkov\u00e1 Winklmayr, a Czech model, with whom he had three children\u2014 Donald, Jr. , Ivanka , and Eric\u2014before the couple divorced in 1992. Their married life, as well as Trump\u2019s business affairs, were a staple of the tabloid press in New York City during the 1980s. Trump married the American actress Marla Maples after she gave birth to Trump\u2019s fourth child, Tiffany, in 1993. Their marriage ended in divorce in 1999. In 2005 Trump married the Slovene model Melania Knauss, and their son, Barron, was born the following year. Melania Trump became the second foreign-born first lady of the United States upon Trump\u2019s inauguration as president in 2017. When the U.S. economy fell into recession in 1990, many of Trump\u2019s businesses suffered, and he soon had trouble making payments on his approximately $5 billion debt, some $900 million of which he had personally guaranteed. Under a restructuring agreement with several banks, Trump was forced to surrender his airline, which was taken over by US Airways in 1992; to sell the Trump Princess ; to take out second or third mortgages on nearly all of his properties and to reduce his ownership stakes in them; and to commit himself to living on a personal budget of $450,000 a year. Despite those measures, the Trump Taj Mahal declared bankruptcy in 1991, and two other casinos owned by Trump, as well as his Plaza Hotel in New York City, went bankrupt in 1992. Following those setbacks, most major banks refused to do any further business with him. Estimates of Trump\u2019s net worth during this period ranged from $1.7 billion to minus $900 million. Trump\u2019s fortunes rebounded with the stronger economy of the later 1990s and with the decision of the Frankfurt -based Deutsche Bank AG to establish a presence in the U.S. commercial real estate market. Deutsche Bank extended hundreds of millions of dollars in credit to Trump in the late 1990s and the 2000s for projects including Trump World Tower (2001) in New York and Trump International Hotel and Tower (2009) in Chicago . In the early 1990s Trump had floated a plan to his creditors to convert his Mar-a-Lago estate into a luxury housing development consisting of several smaller mansions, but local opposition led him instead to turn it into a private club, which was opened in 1995. In 1996 Trump partnered with the NBC television network to purchase the Miss Universe Organization, which produced the Miss Universe, Miss USA, and Miss Teen USA beauty pageants. Trump\u2019s casino businesses continued to struggle, however: in 2004 his company Trump Hotels & Casino Resorts filed for bankruptcy after several of its properties accumulated unmanageable debt, and the same company, renamed Trump Entertainment Resorts, went bankrupt again in 2009. Beginning in the mid-2000s, Trump enjoyed an enormous financial windfall from the success of The Apprentice , a reality television series in which he starred that directly earned him nearly $200 million over a 16-year period. The Emmy -nominated show, in each episode of which Trump \u201cfired\u201d one or more contestants competing for a lucrative one-year contract as a Trump employee, further enhanced his reputation as a shrewd businessman and self-made billionaire. In 2008 the show was revamped as The Celebrity Apprentice , which featured news makers and entertainers as contestants. Trump marketed his name as a brand in numerous other business ventures, including Trump Financial, a mortgage company, and the Trump Entrepreneur Initiative (formerly Trump University), an online education company focusing on real estate investment and entrepreneurialism. The latter firm, which ceased operating in 2011, was the target of class-action lawsuits by former students and a separate action by the attorney general of New York state, alleging fraud . After initially denying the allegations, Trump settled the lawsuits for $25 million in November 2016. In 2019, more than two years into his presidency, Trump agreed to pay $2 million in damages and to admit guilt to settle another lawsuit by the attorney general of New York that had accused him of illegally using assets from his charity, the Trump Foundation, to fund his 2016 presidential campaign. As part of the settlement, the Trump Foundation was dissolved. In 2018 The New York Times published a lengthy investigative report that documented how Fred Trump had regularly transferred vast sums of money, ultimately amounting to hundreds of millions of dollars, to his children by means of strategies that involved tax, securities, and real estate fraud, as well as by legal means. According to the report, Donald Trump was the main beneficiary of the transfers, having received the equivalent (in 2018 dollars) of $413 million by the early 2000s. According to a later report by the Times , based on data from tax returns filed by Trump during an 18-year period starting in 2000, Trump paid no federal taxes in 11 years and only $750 in each of two years, 2016 and 2017. Trump was able to reduce his tax obligations to levels significantly below the average for the wealthiest Americans by claiming massive losses on many of his businesses; by deducting as business expenses costs associated with his residences and his personal aircraft; and by receiving, on the basis of business losses, a tentative refund from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) of nearly $73 million, which more than covered the federal taxes Trump had paid on income he received from The Apprentice in 2005\u201308. The refund became the subject of an IRS audit and a legally mandated review by the congressional Joint Committee on Taxation. Trump was credited as coauthor of a number of books on entrepreneurship and his business career, including Trump: The Art of the Deal (1987), Trump: The Art of the Comeback (1997), Why We Want You to Be Rich (2006), Trump 101: The Way to Success (2006), and Trump Never Give Up: How I Turned My Biggest Challenges into Success (2008).

A Secret Service agent fired on the man, who fled and was then apprehended by Florida law enforcement. [24] [25] Nobody was injured. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) said it was investigating the incident as an assassination attempt on Trump. [26] The man in custody was identified as Ryan Routh. [25] On September 24, a grand jury in Miami voted to indict Routh on three firearms-related charges, one charge of assaulting a federal officer, and one charge of attempted assassination of a major presidential candidate. [27] Routh pleaded not guilty. [28] A trial is scheduled for February 10, 2024, with United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida Judge Aileen Cannon presiding. [29] [30] Campaign rally shooting and attempted assassination (2024) See also: Attempted assassinations of Donald Trump, 2024 Former President Donald Trump (R) held a presidential campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania , on July 13, 2024.

[32] U.S. Secret Service agents killed the shooter shortly after the shots were fired. [33] The Federal Bureau of Investigation identified the shooter as Thomas Matthew Crooks on July 14, 2024. [35] Found liable in New York civil fraud case (2024) On February 16, 2024, New York Supreme Court 1st Judicial District Judge Arthur F. Engoron (D) issued a ruling finding former President Donald Trump (R), two of his sons, his company, and executives of his company liable in a civil fraud case for inflating the value of his assets, which allowed him to receive loans and insurance at lower rates than he would otherwise have been able to receive. Trump was ordered to pay $454 million in penalties and interest to the state, was barred from acting as an officer or director of any company in New York for three years, and an independent monitor was appointed to oversee the company's financial reporting. [36] The lawsuit was filed by New York Attorney General Letitia James (D) in 2022. [37] In his ruling, Engoron wrote, \"In order to borrow more and at lower rates, defendants submitted blatantly false financial data to the accountants, resulting in fraudulent financial statements. When confronted at trial with the statements, defendants\u2019 fact and expert witnesses simply denied reality, and defendants failed to accept responsibility or to impose internal controls to prevent future recurrences. As detailed herein, this Court now finds defendants liable, continues the appointment of an Independent Monitor, orders the installation of an Independent Director of Compliance, and limits defendants\u2019 right to conduct business in New York for a few years.\" [38] Trump issued a statement in response to the ruling saying,  \"The Justice System in New York State, and America as a whole, is under assault by partisan, deluded, biased Judges and Prosecutors. Racist, Corrupt A.G. Tish James has been obsessed with 'Getting Trump' for years, and used Crooked New York State Judge Engoron to get an illegal, unAmerican judgment against me, my family, and my tremendous business. I helped New York City during its worst of times, and now, while it is overrun with Violent Biden Migrant Crime, the Radicals are doing all they can to kick me out.\" [39] On February 26, 2024, Trump appealed the ruling. [40] A five-judge panel of the New York Supreme Court, Appellate Division , issued a ruling on Trump's appeal on March 25, 2024, the deadline by which Trump needed to post bond in order to further appeal the ruling. The court reduced the bond from $454 million to $175 million, and extended the bond deadline by ten days. The court also stayed the portion of Engoron's ruling that barred Trump from acting as an officer or director of any company in New York for three years pending appeals, but allowed the installation of an independent monitor to proceed according to the initial ruling. [41] [42] Trump posted the $175 million bond on April 1, 2024. [43] Criminal indictment by Georgia grand jury (2023-2024) See also: Georgia prosecution of Donald Trump, 2023-2024 Former President Donald Trump (R) was indicted on 13 criminal charges related to interference in the 2020 presidential election results in Georgia . Trump pleaded not guilty on August 31. [44] Judge Scott McAfee struck three of these charges for lack of specificity on March 13, 2024, and struck an additional two charges based on the U.S. Constitution's Supremacy Clause on September 12, 2024. [45] [46] Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis (D) filed the indictment in Fulton Superior Court in Georgia, but the Georgia Court of Appeals removed her from the case on December 19, 2025. [47] Before Trump assumed office as the 47th president, the case was heard by Judge Scott McAfee . [48] The indictment was unsealed on August 14, 2023, the same day it was announced that the grand jury had voted to issue an indictment. [49] It included the following charges against Trump: [49] violation of Georgia's Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO) Act; conspiracy to impersonate a public officer, to commit first degree forgery, to commit false statements and writings, and to file false documents; filing false documents; and issuing false statements and writings. The indictment included a total of 41 criminal counts related to interference in Georgia's 2020 presidential election results against 19 defendants, including Trump, former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani (R), former White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows , former Georgia Republican Party Chairman David Shafer , and Georgia State Senator Shawn Still (R), among others. [49] McAfee struck six of these counts in March 2024 due to lack of specificity. [45] To view a full list of defendants and the charges issued against each, click here . Trump's campaign issued a statement shortly before the indictment was released, saying, \"GA's radical Democrat District Attorney Fani Willis is a rabid partisan who is campaigning and fundraising on a platform of prosecuting President Trump through these bogus indictments. [...] They are taking away President Trump's First Amendment right to free speech, and the right to challenge a rigged and stolen election that the Democrats do all the time.\" [50] In a press conference after the indictment was released, Willis said, \"I remind everyone here that an indictment is only a series of allegations based on a grand jury's determination of probable cause to support the charges. It is now the duty of my office to prove these charges in the indictment beyond a reasonable doubt at trial.\" [51] The indictment followed a special grand jury investigation into whether Trump and his allies attempted to change the outcome of the 2020 presidential election in Georgia. The grand jury convened in May 2022, and completed its investigation in January 2023. [52] Criminal indictment by Washington, D.C., grand jury (2023-2024) See also: Federal prosecution of Donald Trump, 2023-2024 (2020 election certification case) A federal grand jury charged former President Donald Trump (R) with four criminal counts related to the certification of the 2020 presidential election in August 2023. Trump pleaded not guilty. [53] Judge Tanya S. Chutkan oversaw the proceedings. [54] Special counsel Jack Smith moved to dismiss the case without prejudice on November 25, 2024. The U.S. Constitution prohibits the criminal prosecution of a sitting president, and Donald Trump (R) won the 2024 presidential election on November 5. In his filing, Smith wrote \"That prohibition is categorical and does not turn on the gravity of the crimes charged, the strength of the Government\u2019s proof, or the merits of the prosecution, which the Government stands fully behind.\" [55] In July 2024, the Supreme Court ruled on Trump's claim of presidential immunity in the case, saying in a 6-3 decision written by Chief Justice John Roberts that presidents have absolute immunity for core constitutional powers and no immunity for unofficial actions. The case was remanded to a lower court to determine which charges in the indictment could proceed. [56] Smith released a superseding indictment on August 27, 2024, which maintained the same charges against Trump with an adjusted presentation to adhere to the Supreme Court's ruling. [57] The original indictment was filed in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia . It included the following charges alleged against Trump: conspiracy to defraud the United States \"by using dishonesty, fraud and deceit to obstruct the nation\u2019s process of collecting, counting, and certifying the results of the presidential election;\" conspiracy to obstruct the certification of the electoral vote on January 6, 2021 ; obstruction of the certification of the electoral vote on January 6, 2021; and conspiracy \"to injure, oppress, threaten, and intimidate one or more persons in the free exercise and enjoyment of\" the right to vote and have one's vote counted. [58] In November 2022, U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland appointed Smith to investigate whether any individual or entity \"unlawfully interfered with the transfer of power following the 2020 presidential election or the certification of the Electoral College vote held on or about January 6, 2021.\" [59] Before this appointment, Smith served as a chief prosecutor for the special court in The Hague, Netherlands, where he investigated war crimes in Kosovo. [60] Criminal indictment by Florida grand jury (2023-2024) See also: Noteworthy criminal misconduct in American politics (2023-2024) and Federal prosecution of Donald Trump, 2023-2024 (classified documents case) A federal grand jury charged Former President Donald Trump (R) with 40 criminal counts related to his handling of classified documents in June and July 2023. Trump pleaded not guilty. This was the first federal indictment of a former U.S. president. [61] [62] U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida Judge Aileen Cannon dismissed the case on July 15, 2024, on the grounds that special counsel Jack Smith 's appointment violated the Appointments Clause and the Appropriations Clause of the U.S. Constitution. [63] Smith filed an appeal, but later withdrew the appeal after Trump won the 2024 presidential election. [64] [65] The court unsealed the original indictment on June 9, 2023, which contained 37 criminal counts. A superseding indictment was released on July 27, 2023, and added three additional charges, resulting in a total of forty criminal counts. Thirty-two counts were on the willful retention of national defense information. The other counts included: [66] [62] conspiracy to obstruct justice; withholding a document or record; corruptly concealing a document or record; concealing a document in a federal investigation; scheme to conceal; false statements and representations; attempting to alter, destroy, or conceal evidence; and compelling another individual to alter, destroy, or conceal evidence. Found liable for sexual abuse and defamation by New York jury (2023) See also: Sexual assault and harassment in American politics (2023-2024) On May 9, 2023, a United States District Court for the Southern District of New York jury found Trump liable for sexually abusing and defaming E. Jean Carroll. Trump was ordered to pay Carroll $5 million in damages. [67] [68] Judge Lewis Kaplan presided over the case. Following the ruling, Trump said, \"I have absolutely no idea who this woman is. This verdict is a disgrace - a continuation of the greatest witch hunt of all time!\" [69] Carroll issued a statement after the ruling, saying, \"I filed this lawsuit against Donald Trump to clear my name and to get my life back. Today, the world finally knows the truth. This victory is not just for me but for every woman who has suffered because she was not believed.\" [70] Trump's attorneys filed a notice with the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit on May 11, 2023, stating that he would appeal the verdict. [71] In a June 2019 New York Magazine article, Carroll said that Trump sexually assaulted her in the mid-1990s. [72] At the time, Trump released a statement saying, \"I\u2019ve never met this person in my life. She is trying to sell a new book - that should indicate her motivation. It should be sold in the fiction section.\" [72] Carroll initiated the lawsuit in November 2022. The complaint said, \"When Carroll\u2019s account was published, Trump lashed out with a series of false statements. He denied the rape. Trump made additional false claims about Carroll in 2022. [...] Trump\u2019s underlying sexual assault severely injured Carroll, causing significant pain and suffering, lasting psychological harms, loss of dignity, and invasion of her privacy. His recent defamatory statement has only added to the harm that Carroll had already suffered.\" [73] The suit was brought under New York's Adult Survivors Act, a 2022 law that created a one-year window for adults who experienced a sexual offense before 2019, when the state extended the statute of limitations for civil lawsuits about certain sexual offenses, to file claims in civil court. [74] Convicted of 34 counts of falsifying business records by New York jury (2023) See also: Noteworthy criminal misconduct in American politics (2023-2024) and New York prosecution of Donald Trump, 2023-2025 On May 30, 2024, a Manhattan jury found former President Donald Trump (R) guilty of 34 counts of falsifying business records in the first degree, making Trump the first U.S. president to ever be indicted on and convicted of felony crimes after his time in office.

Trump Inside Trump\u2019s Plot to Corrupt the 2024 Election With \u2018Garbage\u2019 Data Key Takeaways From Our Investigation Into Trump\u2019s Push to Steal 2024 The 45th president of the United States, Donald J. Trump was a celebrity real-estate developer, TV personality, and tabloid mainstay before assuming the presidency in 2016. Born in Queens in 1946, Trump\u2019s real estate empire, three marriages, affairs, and flashy antics within the New York social scene garnered him a celebrity status that culminated in his reality TV show The Apprentice, which ran from 2004-2017. Trump announced his candidacy for the 2016 Republican nomination while descending an escalator at Trump Tower in New York. He maligned immigrants, minorities, women, and his opponents throughout his campaign, but still won the nomination and went on to narrowly defeat Democrat Hillary Clinton in the general election \u2014 although he lost the popular vote. Trump\u2019s presidency was characterized by right-wing extremism and the rapid degradation of American political norms. Hallmarks of his time in office include the appointment of three Supreme Court judges (and the end of federal abortion rights as a result), hardline policies against immigration, a nationalistic approach to foreign policy, two impeachments, a disastrous response to the Covid-19 pandemic, and cozy relationships with authoritarian foreign leaders. Perhaps the most infamous marker of Trump\u2019s time in office was his refusal to leave it. After losing reelection to President Joe Biden in 2020, Trump falsely claimed the election had been fraudulently rigged against him. He declared victory and leveled a slew of legal challenges in various states in an attempt to overturn the will of voters. Ultimately, a mob of his supporters stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, in an attempt to disrupt the certification of the Electoral College vote. Trump continues to insist the 2020 election was stolen from him, and despite currently facing a slew of criminal charges \u2014 both at the federal and state level \u2014 is the Republican frontrunner for the 2024 presidential nomination.\u00a0\u2014 Nikki McCann Ramirez Read more about Donald John Trump First Name Donald Last Name Trump Date of Birth June 14, 1946 Place of Birth Queens, New York Donald Trump Trump\u2019s Excuses for Dire Economic Outlook Are Getting More Ridiculous Stock markets continue to tumble as economic anxiety over the president\u2019s tariff trade war increases 100 Years By Nikki McCann Ramirez Social Security Insiders Warn Trump and Musk Could Break the Program Social Security employees and former commissioner Martin O\u2019Malley say DOGE\u2019s intrusion into the agency could mean seniors not getting their checks Looming Crisis By Justin Glawe Trump Is Leading an \u2018All-Out Assault\u2019 on the Climate The president is threatening the government\u2019s ability to regulate greenhouse-gas emissions, firing scientists, and undermining electric vehicles Moving Backward By Thor Benson Top stories newsletter A Cultural Force That Transcends Generations Enter your Email By providing your information, you agree to our Terms of Use and our Privacy Policy .\n\t\t\t\tWe use vendors that may also process your information to help provide our services.

Ad Feedback Business Investing \u2022 4 min read US stocks plunge after Trump says he won\u2019t rule out a recession By John Towfighi and Lucy Bayly , CNN 4 minute read Updated\n          1:37 PM EDT, Mon March 10, 2025 Link Copied! Stocks have been hammered so far this month amid uncertainty around President Donald Trump\u2019s on-again, off-again tariff policy. Spencer Platt/Getty Images New York CNN \u2014 US stocks plunged Monday, continuing a steep selloff driven by concerns about the impact of President Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs on economic growth. All three major indexes opened sharply lower Monday after Trump said the US economy would see \u201ca period of transition\u201d and refused to rule out a recession, in an interview that aired Sunday. When asked on Fox News\u2019 \u201cSunday Morning Futures With Maria Bartiromo\u201d if he was expecting a recession this year, Trump said \u201cI hate to predict things like that. There is a period of transition because what we\u2019re doing is very big.\u201d The Dow was down by 740 points in midday trading, after opening lower by about 400 points, or 1%. The broader S&P 500 dropped by 2.6% and the Nasdaq Composite plummeted 4%. Tech stocks were leading the selloff Monday, weighing on the S&P 500 and dragging the Nasdaq into correction territory. As of midday, the Nasdaq was on track for its worst day since October 2022. The \u201cMagnificent Seven\u201d of tech stocks \u2014 Alphabet ( GOOG ), Amazon ( AMZN ), Apple ( AAPL ), Meta ( META ), Microsoft ( MSFT ), Nvidia ( NVDA ) and Tesla ( TSLA ) \u2014 were all in the red on Monday. Tesla erases post-election gains Tesla was down 13% midday, leading the slide on Wall Street. After the US presidential election in November, shares of Tesla surged, peaking just before Christmas. However, Tesla stock is down more than 43% this year, wiping out its gains since November. The company\u2019s shares have taken a massive hit in recent weeks amid protests against CEO Elon Musk for his oversized role in the Trump administration, as well as slumping sales in Europe. Elon Musk speaks with President Donald J Trump and reporters in the Oval Office at the White House last month. Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post/Getty Images Related article Wall Street is turning its back on Elon Musk Nvidia fell 5% and Palantir ( PLTR ), another star of the artificial intelligence trade, slid 10%. \u201cWhen stocks overextend on the upside, they overextend on the downside,\u201d said Gina Bolvin, president of Bolvin Wealth Management Group, in an email. The VIX, Wall Street\u2019s fear gauge, surged to its highest level this year. \u201cExtreme fear\u201d has been the sentiment driving markets for the past two weeks, according to CNN\u2019s Fear and Greed Index . Tariff uncertainty spooking Wall Street Stocks have been hammered so far this month amid uncertainty around Trump\u2019s on-again, off-again tariff policy. The S&P 500 slid 3.1% last week, posting its worst week since September. Trump threatened a massive tariff on imports from Canada and Mexico but then announced a reprieve until April 2. He doubled the tariff on all Chinese imports to 20% from 10%, and a 25% tariff on all steel and aluminum imports is set to take effect March 12. In addition, Trump threatened last week to enact a 250% tariff on Canadian dairy products and a \u201ctremendously high\u201d tariff on its lumber. On Sunday he told Fox that tariffs may still \u201cgo up as time goes by.\u201d \u201cThe talk of tariffs is, in a lot of ways, worse than the implementation of them,\u201d said David Bahnsen, chief investment officer at the Bahnsen Group. \u201cThe tariff talk, reversal, speculation, and chaos only fosters uncertainty.\u201d \u201cI do not believe the administration knows how the tariff situation will play out, but if I were a betting man I would say that it will persist long enough to do damage to economic activity for at least a quarter or two, and ultimately result in a deal with different countries that make everyone wonder why we went through all the fuss,\u201d he said in a note Monday. President Donald Trump signs an executive order in the Oval Office of the White House. Samuel Corum/Sipa/Bloomberg/Getty Images Related article Cracks are forming in America\u2019s economy. Trump is a big reason why And cracks are forming elsewhere: Layoffs are mounting, hiring is slowing, consumer confidence is eroding and inflation is picking up. The yield on the 10-year US Treasury slid to 4.215% as investors snapped up government bonds, signaling concerns about uncertainty and economic growth. Looking ahead this week, investors will be attuned to monthly inflation data expected on Wednesday and Thursday to gauge whether inflation remained stubborn in February. A recession is commonly defined by two consecutive negative quarters of gross domestic product growth. The National Bureau of Economic Research\u2019s Business Cycle Dating Committee , the official arbiters, says a recession \u201cinvolves a significant decline in economic activity that is spread across the economy and lasts more than a few months.\u201d \u201cHow long this period of investor caution persists depends on how quickly it will take the global trade clouds, and the resulting threat of recession, to dissipate,\u201d said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA Research, in a note Monday. This is a developing story and will be updated.

FDA says safety inspectors and some other staff cannot take buyout By MATTHEW PERRONE Share Share Copy Link copied Email Facebook X Reddit LinkedIn Pinterest Flipboard Print An email viewed by The Associated Press explains that Food and Drug Administration staffers who handle inspections, criminal investigations and the review of drugs, vaccines, medical devices and other products cannot take the $25,000 buyout. The email lists a number of other roles eligible for the offer, including staffers in administration, finance, communications and other operations. The Department of Health and Human Services, which oversees the FDA and other health agencies, has given staffers until Friday to apply for the payment. Last month the FDA abruptly fired hundreds of staffers, including medical reviewers, only to bring many of them back days later. The agency\u2019s reviewers are mainly funded by fees from the medical industry, not the federal government.

Climate United Fund, a coalition of three nonprofit groups, demanded access to a Citibank account it received through the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, a program created in 2022 by the bipartisan Inflation Reduction Act and more commonly known as the green bank. The freeze threatens its ability to issue loans and even pay employees, the group said. \u201cThe combined actions of Citibank and EPA effectively nullify a congressionally mandated and funded program,\u201d Climate United wrote in a Monday court filing. \u25b6 Read more about the climate group\u2019s lawsuit Crews begin removing \u2018Black Lives Matter\u2019 message painted on street near White House By ASHRAF KHALIL Share Share Copy Link copied Email Facebook X Reddit LinkedIn Pinterest Flipboard Print 1 of 6 | With the White House in the background, demolition begins on the Black Lives Matter mural, Monday, March 10, 2025, in Washington.

Homeland Security app once used for asylum applications is now for leaving the the US By TIM SULLIVAN Share Share Copy Link copied Email Facebook X Reddit LinkedIn Pinterest Flipboard Print The Trump administration has overhauled the cellphone app once used to let migrants apply for asylum, turning it into a system that allows people living illegally in the U.S. to announce they want to voluntarily leave. The renamed app, now called CBP Home, is part of the administration\u2019s campaign to encourage \u201cself-deportations, \u201d touted as an easy and cost-effective way to nudge along Trump\u2019s push to deport millions of immigrants . \u201cThe app provides illegal aliens in the United States with a straightforward way to declare their intent to voluntarily depart, offering them the chance to leave before facing harsher consequences,\u201d Pete Flores, the acting commissioner for U.S Customs and Border Protection, said in a statement. Moments after Trump took office, the former app, CBP One, stopped allowing migrants to apply for asylum, and tens of thousands of border appointments were canceled.

It marked one of his relatively few public comments on what has been a historic shift away from U.S. foreign aid and development, executed by Trump political appointees at State and Elon Musk\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency teams. Rubio in the post thanked DOGE and \u201cour hardworking staff who worked very long hours to achieve this overdue and historic reform\u201d in foreign aid. Trump on Jan. 20 issued an executive order directing a freeze of foreign assistance funding and a review of all of the tens of billions of dollars of U.S. aid and development work abroad. Trump charged that much of foreign assistance was wasteful and advanced a liberal agenda. \u25b6 Read more about Trump\u2019s changes to foreign aid China learned from Trump\u2019s first trade war and changed its tactics when tariffs came again By DIDI TANG Share Share Copy Link copied Email Facebook X Reddit LinkedIn Pinterest Flipboard Print President Donald Trump, right, talks with China\u2019s President Xi Jinping during a welcome ceremony at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing, Nov. 9, 2017. (AP Photo/Andy Wong, File) The leaders of both Canada and Mexico got on the phone with Trump this past week to seek solutions after he slapped tariffs on their countries, but China\u2019s president appears unlikely to make a similar call soon. Beijing, which unlike America\u2019s close partners and neighbors has been locked in a trade and tech war with the U.S. for years, is taking a different approach to Trump in his second term, making it clear that any negotiations should be conducted on equal footing. China\u2019s leaders say they are open to talks, but they also made preparations for the higher U.S. tariffs , which have risen 20% since Trump took office seven weeks ago. Intent on not being caught off guard as they were during Trump\u2019s first term, the Chinese were ready with retaliatory measures \u2014 imposing their own taxes this past week on key U.S. farm imports and more. After the U.S. this past week imposed another 10% tariff, on top of the 10% imposed on Feb. 4, the Chinese foreign ministry uttered its sharpest retort yet : \u201cIf war is what the U.S. wants, be it a tariff war, a trade war or any other type of war, we\u2019re ready to fight till the end.\u201d \u25b6 Read more about China and the U.S. in the trade war Musk and DOGE try to slash government by cutting out those who answer to voters By NICHOLAS RICCARDI Share Share Copy Link copied Email Facebook X Reddit LinkedIn Pinterest Flipboard Print For decades, conservatives in Congress have talked about the need to cut government deeply, but they have always pulled back from mandating specific reductions, fearful of voter backlash. Now, DOGE is trying to do exactly that. The dynamic of cutting government while also cutting out those who answer to voters has alarmed even some fiscal conservatives who have long pushed for Congress to reduce spending through the means laid out in the Constitution: a system of checks and balances that includes lawmakers elected across the country working with the president. \u201cSome members of the Trump administration got frustrated that Congress won\u2019t cut spending and decided to go around them,\u201d said Jessica Reidl of the conservative think tank The Manhattan Institute.

(AP Photo/Gregory Bull) Trump is dismissing business concerns over the uncertainty caused by his planned tariffs on a range of American trading partners and the prospect of higher prices, and isn\u2019t ruling out the possibility of a recession this year. After imposing and then quickly pausing 25% tariffs on imports from Mexico and Canada that sent markets tumbling over concerns of a trade war, Trump said his plans for broader \u201creciprocal\u201d tariffs will go into effect April 2, raising them to match what other countries assess. Asked about the Atlanta Fed\u2019s warning of an economic contraction in the first quarter of the year, Trump seemingly acknowledged that his plans could affect U.S. growth. Still, he claimed, it would ultimately be \u201cgreat for us.\u201d Though Trump\u2019s early implementation of tariffs has been inconsistent \u2014 with him imposing them, then pulling many back \u2014 he has been steadfast in endorsing the idea of 21st century protectionism. There have even been suggestions that higher import tariffs on the country\u2019s foreign trading partners could eventually replace the federal income tax. \u25b6 Read more about concerns surrounding Trump\u2019s tariffs Trump loves the Gilded Age and its tariffs. It was a great time for the rich but not for the many By WILL WEISSERT Share Share Copy Link copied Email Facebook X Reddit LinkedIn Pinterest Flipboard Print In Trump\u2019s idealized framing, the United States was at its zenith in the Gilded Age, a time of rapid population growth and transformation from an agricultural economy toward a sprawling industrial system. The desire to recreate that era is fueled by Trump\u2019s fondness for tariffs and his admiration for the nation\u2019s 25th president, William McKinley. Though Trump\u2019s early implementation of tariffs has been inconsistent \u2014 with him imposing them, then pulling many back \u2014 he has been steadfast in endorsing the idea of 21st century protectionism. There have even been suggestions that higher import tariffs on the country\u2019s foreign trading partners could eventually replace the federal income tax. Experts on the era say Trump is idealizing a time rife with government and business corruption, social turmoil and inequality. They argue he\u2019s also dramatically overestimating the role tariffs played in stimulating an economy that grew mostly due to factors other than the U.S. raising taxes on imported goods. And Gilded Age policies, they maintain, have virtually nothing to do with how trade works in a globalized, modern economy. \u25b6 Read more about Trump and the Gilded Age 1 New Story The Associated Press is an independent global news organization dedicated to factual reporting.

August Pfluger and Rep. Michael Cloud: President Donald Trump showed how Democrats have lost their way Mar 10, 2025 Media Op-Ed: Rep. August Pfluger and Rep. Michael Cloud: President Donald Trump showed how Democrats have lost their way Washington Reporter Rep. August Pfluger & Rep. Michael Cloud | March 10, 2025 In a single evening, the American people witnessed a stark contrast between two visions for our nation. President Donald Trump\u2019s Joint Address to Congress highlighted remarkable Americans who have overcome extraordinary challenges, while Democrats showed exactly who they are: a party that has completely lost its way. As the President recognized heroes in the gallery, Democrats couldn\u2019t even muster the basic decency to stand. When 13-year-old Devarjaye \u201cDJ\u201d Daniel, battling brain and spine cancer while pursuing his dream of working in law enforcement, was made an honorary Secret Service Agent, Democrats remained seated. The President acknowledged Allyson and Lauren Phillips \u2014 the grieving mother and sister of Laken Riley, whose tragic murder inspired legislation signed into law this January \u2014 and Democrats couldn\u2019t be bothered to pay respect. When President Trump recognized Payton McNabb, whose volleyball career ended after suffering a traumatic brain injury when struck by a biological male competitor, Democrats chose politics over compassion. The President also honored Mark Fogel, an American history teacher imprisoned overseas since 2021 and finally brought home, alongside his 95-year-old mother who lobbied tirelessly for his release. Democrats didn\u2019t rise to celebrate his freedom. The only moment that seemed to animate Democrats? When Ukraine was mentioned. Apparently, standing for foreign nations is acceptable, but honoring American citizens who\u2019ve endured unimaginable hardships is not. Instead of showing respect, many Democrats were glued to their phones, while others walked out during the address. Most egregiously, Rep. Al Green (D., Texas) shouted at the President during his speech \u2014 behavior so inappropriate that it resulted in a bipartisan censure vote. This disgraceful display reveals an undeniable truth: today\u2019s Democratic Party has abandoned American values for partisan politics. They have no vision for America\u2019s future \u2014 just blind resistance to President Trump\u2019s agenda. As roughly 36 million people saw, this opposition knows no boundaries; lines will be crossed in disrespecting brave Americans in order to score a point against President Trump. The same opposition extends to the media establishment. When President Trump highlighted wasteful government spending during his address, the fake news media rushed to \u201cfact check\u201d him, only to be proven wrong. Their eagerness to undermine the President rather than investigate government waste exposes their true agenda and where their priorities lie. While Democrats and their media allies obstruct progress, Republicans are charting a clear course forward. In fewer than 50 days, the Trump administration and the Republican Congress are tackling the crises created during four years of failed Democratic leadership. We\u2019re rooting out waste, fraud, and abuse in government agencies, cutting bloated bureaucracy, and redirecting resources to programs that actually serve the American people. Where Democrats brought economic uncertainty, we\u2019re delivering prosperity. Where they created chaos at our border, we\u2019re restoring order. Where they projected weakness abroad, we\u2019re rebuilding American strength. Most importantly, where they expanded government to serve special interests, we\u2019re making government work FOR the American people again. The contrast couldn\u2019t be clearer. One party recognizes and celebrates American resilience, sacrifice, and courage while demanding accountability from our institutions. The other can\u2019t even stand up for a child with cancer, a grieving family, an injured athlete, or a freed American teacher \u2014 and fights to preserve wasteful spending at every turn. Our message to the American people is simple: We see you. We honor your struggles and triumphs. We believe your stories matter more than partisan politics and your tax dollars deserve respect. The golden age of American renewal has begun. With President Trump\u2019s leadership and a unified Republican Congress, we will deliver the secure, prosperous future that every American deserves \u2014 including those Democrats refused to honor. It\u2019s a time for choosing for the other side of the aisle: Rise with us or watch from the sidelines as we make America great again.

It was a time of rapid population growth and transformation from an agricultural economy toward a sprawling industrial system, in which poverty was widespread while barons of phenomenal wealth held tremendous sway over politicians who often helped further grow their financial empires. READ MORE: Trump doesn\u2019t rule out recession while downplaying business concerns about his tariffs \u201cWe were at our richest from 1870 to 1913. That\u2019s when we were a tariff country. And then they went to an income tax concept,\u201d Trump said days after taking office. \u201cIt\u2019s fine, it\u2019s OK. But it would have been very much better.\u201d The desire to recreate the Gilded Age is fueled by Trump\u2019s fondness for tariffs. It\u2019s also why he praises the nation\u2019s 25th president, William McKinley, a Republican who was in office from 1897 until being assassinated in 1901. Experts on the era say Trump, also a Republican, is idealizing a time rife with government and business corruption, social turmoil and inequality. They also argue he\u2019s dramatically overestimating the role tariffs played in stimulating the economy. \u201cThe most astonishing thing for historians is that nobody in the Gilded Age economy \u2014 except for the very rich \u2014 wanted to live in the Gilded Age economy,\u201d said Richard White, a history professor emeritus at Stanford University. Trump says high tariffs and low interest rates, like those the U.S. had after the Civil War, can hastily pay down today\u2019s federal debt and fatten government coffers while boosting domestic manufacturers and enticing foreign producers to move to the U.S. READ MORE: 5 things to know about tariffs and how they work The White House has rushed to raise tariffs on imports from China and on aluminum and steel made abroad while promising import levies will soon increase on new, foreign-made cars, microchips and pharmaceuticals. Trump also increased tariffs on Canada and Mexico, though he later delayed most of them. Trump has similar plans for potentially every country the U.S. does business with, saying broad \u201creciprocal\u201d import taxes are coming April 2 and will be consistent with levies other countries charge U.S. manufacturers to export their goods. Was America really at its wealthiest from 1870 to 1913? The Gilded Age featured extraordinary wealth for a small class of people that largely obscured rampant poverty for many other Americans. Many contemporary politicians were openly influenced by the famed robber barons, builders of monopolies who stoked industrialization while shaping the way millions of other Americans lived and worked. Overall, the U.S. economy grew rapidly between 1870 and 1913. Some historians call it the second industrial revolution because of major increases in manufacturing and factory output. But White said that those years were marked by erratic economic growth and that upturns were mostly fueled by millions of immigrants joining the U.S. workforce. Another factor was the seizing of land from Native Americans during U.S. expansion west. That meant exploiting natural resources along the way. \u201cThis is the height of antimonopoly, political turmoil, the rise of labor in the United States,\u201d said White, author of \u201cThe Republic for Which it Stands: The United States during Reconstruction and the Gilded Age, 1865-1896.\u201d \u201cAnd the reason was, people did not regard this as a particularly healthy economy.\u201d Why does Trump revere McKinley? In his inaugural address, Trump called McKinley a \u201cgreat president\u201d and \u201cnatural business man,\u201d who he said \u201cmade our country very rich through tariffs and through talent.\u201d Hours later, Trump signed an executive order overturning an Obama administration directive and renaming America\u2019s tallest peak Mount McKinley. But today\u2019s economy is immeasurably different than in McKinley\u2019s time. Back then, products were often fully assembled before being exported, and shipping could take months. Today\u2019s goods often contain raw material components or parts that need to be assembled, that come from all over the world. Supply chains are calibrated based on instantaneous communications. McKinley was a congressman representing a steel-producing Ohio district known as the \u201cNapoleon of Protectionism.\u201d He championed the Tariff Act of 1890, which set the then-highest import tax in U.S. history. \u201cIt led to an increase in prices, a kind of inflation, even before the bill took effect,\u201d said Robert Merry, author of \u201cPresident McKinley: Architect of the American Century.\u201d \u201cThe argument was, it was carte blanche for retailers and industrialists who basically jacked up their prices unnecessarily.\u201d Voters dealt Republicans landslide congressional defeats during the 1890 midterms when even McKinley lost. He eventually rebounded to win the presidency in 1896. Ignoring the political problems tariffs created for Republicans, Trump instead has focused on repeating how high tariffs after the Civil War helped the U.S. pay off debts and eventually achieve government budget surpluses. From 1866 to 1893, the U.S. ran nearly three straight decades of budget surpluses, fueled largely by tariffs and high domestic taxes on things like alcohol and tobacco as well as the sale of federal lands. But federal budget surpluses eventually began to effectively decrease the U.S. money supply and cause deflation. Meanwhile, higher tariffs continued to increase the cost of living, which, coupled with a financial crisis in Great Britain, helped trigger the devastating economic depression known as the Panic of 1893. McKinley changed his mind on tariffs Shortly after winning reelection in 1900, meanwhile, McKinley began rethinking tariffs, as stronger U.S. manufacturing had made him more appreciative of foreign markets. \u201cMcKinley began to see that, if we were going to be able to sell our goods overseas, as we were going to need to do because we would have more goods than we\u2019d have a market for, we were going to have to accept goods as well,\u201d Merry said. He said that McKinley gave a speech in Buffalo, New York, on Sept. 5, 1901, outlining \u201cthis concept of reciprocity, which was: I\u2019m prepared to bring down tariffs. Even me. Even William McKinley.\u201d Trump is now promising that similar, reciprocal tariffs will take effect next month. But pulling that off will be another difference from McKinley. The day after his Buffalo speech, McKinley was shot. He died on Sept. 14, 1901.

Donald Trump during the season finale of \"The Celebrity Apprentice\"\u00a0 on May 10, 2009. Bill Tompkins / Getty Images By Keir Simmons and Patrick Smith Amazon has announced it will begin streaming \" The Apprentice \" \u2014 the reality TV show famous for boosting Donald Trump's profile \u2014 on its Prime Video service on Monday. It's the first time the show will be available on a streaming service,  and the move highlights the close link between Trump's time as a reality TV personality and his being elected presiden t twice . The show's executive producer, Mark Burnett, remains one of his closest allies. Burnett, the British producer behind \"The Apprentice,\" as well as \"Survivor\" and \"Shark Tank,\" was appointed special envoy to the United Kingdom in December. \"'The Apprentice' is one of the best shows that I ever produced. The charismatic onscreen presence of President Donald J. Trump made it a bona fide hit!\" Burnett said in a press release. Trump, who was an executive producer on the show alongside Burnett, said in the release: \"I look forward to watching this show myself \u2014 such great memories, and so much fun. but most importantly, it was a learning experience for all of us!\" \u201cThe Apprentice\u201d ran on NBC from 2004 to 2017, attracting an average of 20 million viewers a week and 28 million for the season one finale, Amazon said. NBCUniversal is the parent company of NBC and NBC News. The show pitted 16 contestants against one another for the chance to win a job working for Trump with a $250,000 salary. Hopefuls were dumped from the show each week with Trump\u2019s catchphrase: \u201cYou\u2019re fired.\u201d Burnett added that \u201cSurvivor\u201d found new fans thanks to audiences discovering it on streaming during the pandemic. \u201cOn Monday, March 10, this same phenomenon will begin again ... with \u2018The Apprentice.\u2019\u201d But none of the stars of Burnett\u2019s other shows have the same retrospective importance as Trump, and both his critics and admirers will now be able to watch, some for the first time, the show that lifted his public profile long before his run for the White House in 2017. Viewers will see Trump developing his skills in front of a camera, an ability he exploited on the campaign trail and in office to simply and effectively communicate with his audience. Trump explains in the first episode that he had gone bankrupt and fought his way back \u2014 a depiction of the personality that years later would come to dominate the Republican Party and win two terms in office. The show\u2019s return may also pose questions for Amazon founder and executive chairman Jeff Bezos, who attended Trump\u2019s inauguration in January alongside other tech billionaires. Bezos attracted criticism for ending the tradition at The Washington Post, which he owns, of endorsing a presidential candidate. In January, Amazon Prime Video licensed an upcoming documentary about first lady Melania Trump . At the time, Bezos did not respond to a request for comment on whether he was involved in securing the deal. Last month, Bezos\u2019 decision that the opinion section take a new direction and focus only on \u201cpersonal liberties and free markets, prompted criticism and caused the section\u2019s editor, David Shipley, to step down.

Ben Curtis/AP hide caption toggle caption Ben Curtis/AP President Trump defended his administration's economic policy after he imposed tariffs on Mexico and Canada last week and then rolled some of those levies back, causing what critics say is uncertainty for businesses and the broader economy. During an interview with Fox News Channel's Sunday Morning Futures , Trump dismissed concerns over his back-and-forth tariffs and said they \"could go up.\" Fox News' Maria Bartiromo asked Trump whether he expects a recession during his first year in office. The president couldn't say. \"I hate to predict things like that,\" Trump said. \"There is a period of transition, because what we're doing is very big. We're bringing wealth back to America. That's a big thing. And there are always periods of it takes a little time.\" Sponsor Message There are some signs that the economy may be headed toward a recession, but Howard Lutnick, the Commerce secretary, told NBC's Meet the Press there was \"no chance\" of one. Last week, the Trump administration said it would place a 25% tariff on cars and auto parts from Mexico and Canada. Soon after, the White House announced a one-month delay on the measure after carmakers Ford, Stellantis and General Motors called the president. During his interview with Bartiromo, Trump explained the move. \"This is short term and I felt for the good of the American carmakers,\" Trump said. \"I thought it would be a fair thing to do. And so I gave them a little bit of a break for this short period of time.\" Criticism from automakers notwithstanding, Sean Fain, the head of the United Auto Workers, called the tariffs an \"attempt to stop the bleeding\" in the American economy. Tariffs \"aren't the end solution,\" he told ABC's This Week , \"but they are a huge factor in fixing this problem.\" Meanwhile, the stock market had it's worst week in 6 months with the S&P 500 dropping 3.1% and Nasdaq down 3.45%. Fox News' Bartiromo asked the president whether the uncertainty over tariffs \u2014 which many economist say is causing stocks to slump \u2014 will continue or if there will be clarity for businesses. Sponsor Message \"Well I think so,\" Trump said. \"But you know the tariffs could go up as time goes by and they may go up.\" Trump also said he still plans to put  in place next month \"reciprocal\" tariffs against all trading partners that have tariffs on U.S. goods. \"April 2nd, it becomes all reciprocal,\" he said. \"What they charge us, we charge them.\" trump Tariffs Facebook Flipboard Email Read & Listen Home News Culture Music Podcasts & Shows Connect Newsletters Facebook Instagram Press Public Editor Corrections Contact & Help About NPR Overview Diversity NPR Network Accessibility Ethics Finances Get Involved Support Public Radio Sponsor NPR NPR Careers NPR Shop NPR Events NPR Extra Terms of Use Privacy Your Privacy Choices Text Only Sponsor Message Become an NPR sponsor"}

His unpredictable tenure saw the beginning of a trade war between the US and China. The trade war persisted after he left office following a 2020 defeat to Joe Biden. In 2024 he mounted a third campaign, defeating Biden's then-VP, Kamala Harris, to earn a second term as president.

It\u2019s official: The United States\u2019 47th president is Donald Trump. This is Trump\u2019s second presidential victory and his third bid for office. Since first leaving office in 2020, Trump has threatened to enact policies that would endanger immigrant families, further restrict reproductive health, and weaponize the federal government against protesters and political opponents. Now that he has returned to the White House and will be buoyed by many allies in his cabinet and in Congress, these threats could become real. The ACLU is prepared for this threat. We took legal action against Trump\u2019s administration more than 430 times when he was first in office. We have the playbook to fight back \u2013 and win \u2013 once again. We\u2019ve planned for how Trump\u2019s proposed policies will affect our civil rights and civil liberties and are ready to take action.

Explore resource Firewall For Freedom: States Must Safeguard Our Rights Resource Firewall For Freedom: States Must Safeguard Our Rights Take action with ACLU People Power! Firewall For Freedom: States Must Safeguard Our Rights Highlights From Our Previous Fights Donald Trump will return to the White House in January. The ACLU is ready. January 2017 The Muslim Ban A week after Trump was inaugurated, he issued an executive order barring people from several Muslim-majority countries from entering the United States, carrying out his campaign promise to bar Muslims visitors and immigrants. Less than 24 hours after the order was issued, the ACLU and our partners filed the first lawsuit against Trump\u2019s Muslim ban. The ACLU eventually brought 28 lawsuits against the ban, and blocked the first and second versions of Trump\u2019s executive order, protecting thousands of people. August 2017 Transgender Military Ban The ACLU sued the Trump administration when it attempted to ban transgender people from enlisting in the armed forces, as well as bar transgender service members from continuing to serve in the military or receiving medically-necessary health care. Filed on behalf of six transgender service members, the lawsuit argued that the directive violated due process and equal protection. October 2017 Abortion Ban for Unaccompanied Immigrant Minors The ACLU filed an emergency lawsuit challenging a Trump administration policy denying abortion care for unaccompanied immigrant minors in government custody. Representing Jane Doe, a pregnant teenager who was denied an abortion, the ACLU successfully secured relief from the courts and our case ultimately led the Trump administration to abandon its policy. February 2018 Family Separation at the Border The ACLU filed a lawsuit seeking the immediate reunification of a mother and daughter who were forcibly separated after crossing the U.S.-Mexico border. That client, Ms. L., became the lead plaintiff in a class action that revealed a devastating effort to use family separation to deter immigrants from entering the U.S. and resulted in a nationwide injunction ending the practice, followed by a landmark settlement providing critical support to thousands of separated families. The ACLU continues to work to reunify families and implement the settlement. June 2018 2020 Census Citizenship Question The ACLU filed a lawsuit challenging the Trump administration\u2019s plan to include a citizenship question on the 2020 census, which would have chilled participation by people of color and mixed-immigration status families. The lawsuit, filed on behalf of multiple immigrants\u2019 rights groups, argued that the question would hurt states with large immigrant communities, causing them to lose seats in Congress and federal funding. We won the case, which went all the way to the Supreme Court level. November 2018 Asylum Bans and Restrictions The ACLU and our partners filed multiple lawsuits challenging successive Trump administration attempts to dismantle the asylum system, including the so-called entry ban , transit ban , return to Mexico policy , \u201c safe third country \u201d arrangements, and Title 42 expulsions . We blocked some, but not all, of these restrictions. February 2019 Southern Border Wall Days after Trump declared a national emergency to illegally transfer military construction and Treasury forfeiture funds to build border wall segments that Congress had refused to fund, the ACLU sued. Filed on behalf of the Sierra Club and Southern Border Communities Coalition, the lawsuit argued that the emergency declaration was unauthorized, and that border wall construction would hurt border communities, endanger wildlife, and damage the environment. After blocking Trump\u2019s transfer of funds in the federal courts, we settled the case with the Joe Biden administration. July 2020 Death Penalty Abuse and Expansion The ACLU sued the Trump administration , stating that its rush to execute Wesley Purkey during the COVID-19 pandemic violated his right to religious liberty because his spiritual advisor was medically compromised and could not attend the execution safely during the pandemic. The Trump administration\u2019s brutal use of the death penalty led to 13 people being executed in the last nine months Trump was in office."}

Upgrade Now Trump is fulfilling his crypto promises. It\u2019s no longer enough for investors. David Hollerith \u00b7 Senior Reporter Mon, Mar 10, 2025, 5:59 PM 4 min read In This Article: COIN -14.08% BTC-USD -4.79% ETH-USD -5.15% XRP-USD -2.96% The price of bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) continues falling despite efforts by President Trump to give the crypto world more of what it wants, including a strategic bitcoin reserve that the administration touted at the end of last week while hosting crypto executives at the White House . The world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency fell below $80,000 on Monday and is now down 27% from its all-time high above $109,000 the day of Trump's inauguration in January. Other digital assets beyond bitcoin also fell Monday, including ethereum ( ETH ) and XRP ( XRP ). CCC - CoinMarketCap \u2022 USD (BTC-USD) Follow View Quote Details 78,531.93 - (-4.79%) As of 5:38:00 PM UTC. Market Open. BTC-USD ETH-USD XRP-USD Advanced Chart Trump\u2019s pro-crypto stance was enough to lift digital assets higher in the period after his November election due to widespread optimism about a more favorable approach to the industry in Washington, D.C. But that pro-crypto stance is no longer enough to overcome a variety of other economic worries, including growing concerns about the US economy and Trump\u2019s unpredictable trade policy. \"While the early parts of the crypto sell-off in January and early February had nothing to do with the global macro picture, the last two weeks have 100% been driven by the equity market tantrum,\" Jeff Dorman, chief investment officer for crypto asset manager Arca, said in a Monday note. There was also some disappointment within the crypto industry about Trump\u2019s bitcoin reserve announcement last week. Some were hoping the government would make it clear that it would be buying more digital assets, as opposed to simply seeding the stockpile with crypto already seized in legal proceedings. \"The market reaction reflects a reset in expectations,\" Haider Rafique, chief marketing officer for crypto exchange OKX, said via email. While Rafique said he considers the reserve a \"milestone\" that \u201ccements bitcoin\u2019s legitimacy on the global stage,\" he pointed out that the order won\u2019t immediately drive more demand for the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency \u2014 thus \"disappointing those expecting aggressive accumulation\" by the US government.

(Photo by Johnnie Izquierdo for The Washington Post via Getty Images) \u00b7 The Washington Post via Getty Images Monday\u2019s move down was the latest example of how bitcoin\u2019s price has whipsawed in recent weeks as it experienced its worst correction since a 2022 meltdown . \"Crypto is still a risk asset, and also it needs more liquidity,\" MarketVector\u2019s Martin Leinweber told Yahoo Finance last week. The bitcoin strategic reserve announced last week was one of Trump's biggest promises to the crypto world, something he touted while on the campaign trail last year while pledging to make the US the \"crypto capital of the planet.\" Trump\u2019s crypto czar David Sacks said on X that the US government owns an estimated 200,000 bitcoins worth over $17 billion after selling off about half of what it acquired through criminal seizures, although he said there has never been a complete audit. Story Continues Had the government not sold that sum for roughly $360 million over the last decade, according to White House officials, its bitcoin holdings would potentially be worth $17 billion more. Sacks said the US will not sell any bitcoin once it is in the reserve and that it will be kept as a store of value. The reserve, he added, \"is like a digital Fort Knox for the cryptocurrency often called 'digital gold.'\" Crypto czar David Sacks speaks to the media outside the White House ahead of a White House crypto summit last Friday. REUTERS/Evelyn Hockstein \u00b7 REUTERS / Reuters One unknown question about the reserve announced last week by Sacks and Trump is whether it will be used to buy more bitcoin beyond the assets already held by the US government. Sacks said that the secretaries of Treasury and Commerce have the authorization \u201cto develop budget-neutral strategies for acquiring additional bitcoin, provided that those strategies have no incremental costs on American taxpayers.\u201d Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told CNBC Friday that seized crypto assets would go into the reserve first and \"then we'll see what the way forward is for more acquisitions for the reserve. And we're starting with bitcoin, but it's an overall crypto reserve.\" But Sacks made it clear the government would not acquire additional assets for that stockpile beyond those obtained through forfeiture proceedings. Coinbase Global ( COIN ) CEO Brain Armstrong told Yahoo Finance that because \"the United States government is now a holder of bitcoin, maybe a buyer,\" he thinks \"the rest of the G20 [countries] are going to see that as a signal that bitcoin is really the successor to the gold standard.\" Trump, he added, \u201creally breathed life back into this industry.\" Click here for the latest crypto news, updates, and more related to ethereum and bitcoin prices, crypto ETFs, and market implications for cryptocurrencies Read the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance View Comments Terms and Privacy Policy Privacy & Cookie Settings More Info Recommended Stories Copyright \u00a9 2025 Yahoo.

Some in Illinois and Oregon Also Want Border Changes Associated Press | March 10, 2025, 11:17 am Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker delivers his State of the State and budget address before the General Assembly at the Illinois State Capitol, Feb. 19, 2025. (Brian Cassella / Chicago Tribune via AP, Pool, File) As\u00a0President Donald Trump\u00a0floats grand ideas like reacquiring the\u00a0Panama Canal\u00a0and taking over\u00a0Greenland, some rural residents of Illinois and Oregon are promoting geopolitical change of their own: They want to break away from their states, and perhaps unite with Indiana and Idaho. Proponents say they have more in common with their rural brethren across state lines than they do with urbanites in Chicago and Portland, Oregon. And they contend the Democratic-led cities have so much clout in state government that rural, Republican voices get drowned out. In the last five years, voters in 33 Illinois counties have been asked if they want to consider separating from Chicago\u2019s Cook County to form a new state. Each time, a majority said yes. Thanks to our sponsors: View all sponsors Some politicians in neighboring Indiana seem up for the idea. The state\u2019s House of Representatives recently advanced legislation that would welcome Illinois counties into Indiana\u2019s fold. Such a deal would mark the first major realignment of states since West Virginia separated from Virginia to stick with the Union during the Civil War. Despite a bit of local momentum, there are major obstacles to rejiggering state lines within the U.S. For starters, the states relinquishing counties would have to agree to it, which is a long shot. Congress would have to approve, too. State boundaries have changed at least 50 times throughout U.S. history, according the National Center for Interstate Compacts at The Council of State Governments. Many changes have been relatively minor, accounting for shifting rivers or reestablishing markers from long-ago surveys. But organizers in Illinois and Oregon hope to capitalize on the current political environment. \u201cWith this polarization,\u201d said G.H. Merritt, chair of the pro-breakaway group New Illinois. \u201cI don\u2019t know, man, it might just reach a tipping point.\u201d Why Do Some in Illinois Want to Separate? At least three organizations are pushing for some reconfiguration of Illinois counties to separate from Chicago and its closest suburbs. Cook County contains about 40% of the state\u2019s population, including the majority of Black, Asian and Hispanic residents, and is known for its cultural treasures, deep pension debt and a history of crime. Democrats dominate Chicago-area legislative districts, while Republicans represent most other parts of the state. To Merritt, the problem is that ever since the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 1964 that all legislative seats should be allocated based on population rather than counties, Chicago has had all the political clout. \u201cWhat we experience in Illinois is very similar to what the founders in Colonial times were complaining about,\u201c she said. \u201dWe have taxation without representation.\u201d The ballot measures voters favored would allow officials in each county to work with those from other counties to form a new state. But the proposals stop short of declaring independence. Indiana lawmakers responded to those votes by advancing a bill that could start state-level talks. \u201cInstead of seceding, we think we have something to offer over here,\u201d Indiana House Speaker Todd Huston, a Republican who sponsored the measure, said in an interview. He noted that his state has lower taxes and higher economic growth than Illinois. But don\u2019t count on Illinois being receptive: Earlier this year, Gov. J.B. Pritzker, a Democrat, called the Indiana legislation \u201ca stunt\u201d that would never amount to anything. What\u2019s Going On in Oregon? For several years, residents in rural, Republican-leaning eastern Oregon have been laying the groundwork to separate from the Democratic-dominated counties on the western side of the Cascade Mountains. Their goal is to join reliably red Idaho. The Greater Idaho movement has won nonbinding elections in 13 counties. Supporters have been holding town halls, selling hats and T-shirts and erecting billboards with messages such as \u201cRelease Eastern Oregon.\u201d Idaho\u2019s House passed a measure two years ago inviting Oregon to enter into discussions. But similar measures remain buried in committees in the Oregon Legislature, with scant prospects. \"At this point, the state of Oregon is holding us captive,\u201d said Matt McCaw, executive director of Greater Idaho. State Boundaries Do Shift, But Not Often, or By Much It has been over 150 years since entire counties have shifted states. After Virginia seceded from the U.S. in 1861, union loyalists formed the new state of West Virginia. The fate of two counties remained in dispute until the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 1871 that they belonged to West Virginia. Since then, there have been numerous failed attempts at realignment. Writer Norman Mailer ran for mayor of New York in 1969, calling for the city to become the 51st state; five southern New Jersey counties voted to secede in 1980; and California has withstood several proposals to split the state. Earlier this year, an Iowa lawmaker proposed buying nine southern Minnesota counties. Geographer Garrett Dash Nelson once proposed redrawing all state lines to organize them around metro areas. But he acknowledges the challenges. \u201cI don\u2019t see much evidence that there\u2019s a lot of real political will or interest in redrawing state lines,\u201d said Nelson, president and head curator of the Leventhal Map & Education Center at the Boston Public Library. \u201cIt would be such an enormous lift.\u201d Thanks to our sponsors: View all sponsors Thanks to our sponsors: View all sponsors Tags Indiana Donald Trump Republicans Related Stories Indiana Man Who Killed Brother, 3 Others Will Be Put to Death in State\u2019s 1st Execution in 15 Years For Indiana Woman, \u2018Worst-Case Scenario\u2019 Led Her to Illinois for Abortion Care Grassland Birds Catch a Break: County Line Orchard in Northwest Indiana Won\u2019t Mow Nesting Habitat Until After Breeding Season Ban on Gender-Affirming Care for Minors Allowed to Take Effect in Indiana Indiana Resident With Measles Visited 3 Chicago Hospitals While Contagious, Health Officials Say Indiana Man Rescued After Surviving on Rainwater for 6 Days While Trapped in Crashed Truck Under Bridge Sign up for our morning newsletter to get all of our stories delivered to your mailbox each weekday.

Trump ran an unconventional campaign, one that tapped into the frustrations of millions of Americans who felt their concerns were being ignored by establishment politicians. Still, his statements about immigrants, Obamacare and even his own previous positions were frequently rated untrue or misleading by independent factchecking websites. While Trump raised less money than his Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton, he received free media attention valued at about $5 billion. At 70, Trump was older than any previous U.S. president at the time he took office, and was the fifth commander in chief to have lost the popular vote. He maintained, without credible evidence, that millions of undocumented immigrants voted illegally. \r\nTrump chose Indiana Gov. Mike Pence as his running mate. Pence had been a congressman for 12 years, joining the Tea Party Caucus and building a reputation as a strong social conservative.

Summary Donald Trump JD Vance Former President Donald Trump is vying for another term to continue his \u201cAmerica First\u201d policies, which offer a marked departure from previous Democratic and Republican presidential administrations. Jump To Issue AI and Technology China Climate Change Defense and NATO Global Health and Pandemic Prevention Immigration and Border Security Inflation, Debt, and the Economy Israel, Gaza, and the Middle East Russia\u2013Ukraine Trade AI and Technology As president, Trump unveiled the first national strategies on emerging fields such as cybersecurity and artificial intelligence (AI) . He has painted the development of artificial intelligence as an arms race with China, while feuding with the U.S. tech giants that are leading the technology\u2019s development. Trump signed the first U.S. executive order on AI in 2019, setting out a strategy for promoting the technology. One year later, Congress passed the bipartisan National AI Initiative Act, which included funding for non-defense related AI research and development (R&D). In 2020, he signed an additional executive order creating guidelines for AI adoption by federal agencies.\u00a0The 2024 Republican Party platform calls for repealing Biden\u2019s 2023 executive order on AI, which it says overly restricts the technology\u2019s development. He has described competition between the United States and China over AI as a \u201cworld-changing race.\u201d He says the abundant electricity that will be generated by his energy policies will help U.S. tech giants win the AI arms race. Trump has railed against Silicon Valley giants. He argues that major tech companies such as Google and Meta are a bigger threat to U.S. elections than Russia, due to what he calls their anti-conservative bias. In 2019, Trump\u2019s Justice Department announced a broad antitrust review of large U.S. technology companies, which he accuses of \u201cunconstitutional\u201d censorship against conservatives. Trump says the United States should \u201cembrace\u201d cryptocurrencies and create a national bitcoin stockpile. The Republican platform warns against government surveillance of crypto transactions and opposes the creation of a central bank digital currency (CBDC). Trump also focused on cybersecurity issues. In 2018, he issued guidance that gave U.S. Cyber Command more flexibility in carrying out offensive cyberstrikes. The United States reportedly began using offensive cyber capabilities to support Ukraine in 2022. In 2019, Trump issued an executive order to increase the number of federal employees working on cybersecurity to address what the administration called a shortfall of three hundred thousand practitioners. The shortage of cybersecurity professionals has since grown to almost two million, according to the Department of Defense. China Trump has sought to confront China over what he says is a suite of economic abuses: intellectual property theft, currency manipulation, export and other subsidies, and economic espionage. He says aggressive action is required to protect American workers and to reduce the United States\u2019 large bilateral trade deficit. Trump says his policies would \u201ccompletely eliminate dependence on China in all critical areas,\u201d including electronics, steel, and pharmaceuticals. As president, he started a trade war with China, applying tariffs that now average 18 percent to hundreds of billions of dollars worth of Chinese goods. He has floated tripling these tariffs if reelected. He has said he would revoke China\u2019s \u201cmost favored nation\u201d status, a trade status the United States granted China when it joined the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 2001. He says he would adopt a four-year plan to phase out imports of \u201cessential goods\u201d from China.\u00a0The Republican platform calls for restricting Chinese investment in U.S. real estate and industry. He has emphasized that these tariffs and other import restrictions would apply to \u201cessential medicines,\u201d such as penicillin, which he says should be produced in the United States . The Trump administration condemned Beijing\u2019s state-led industrial policy, which seeks to make China a world leader in advanced technology. While in office, he introduced export controls on semiconductors and chipmaking equipment to prevent China from acquiring such technologies. Trump backed a 2018 reform giving U.S. regulators greater power to review foreign acquisitions by China and other countries and blocked several attempted sales of U.S. technology companies to Chinese firms. He ramped up restrictions on Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei, worrying that such firms can be manipulated by Beijing, but he now opposes the potential ban of TikTok. His administration negotiated a deal with the Chinese government to label the synthetic opioid fentanyl as a controlled substance and ban its production in China. Trump met with representatives of the Uyghurs, a persecuted Muslim minority in western China, and signed legislation sanctioning Chinese officials involved in the widely reported human rights abuses of the group. In 2016, he became the first U.S. president or president-elect since 1979 to speak directly with his Taiwanese counterpart. He increased U.S. Navy patrols in the Taiwan Strait and pushed for more arms sales to Taiwan\u00a0but has\u00a0said the island should pay for U.S. protection. In July 2020, his administration announced that it would reject nearly all Chinese territorial claims in the South China Sea, referencing Beijing\u2019s \u201ccampaign of bullying\u201d in the disputed waters. Climate Change Trump has repeatedly questioned the science of climate change and expressed doubts about whether human activity is responsible. He has pledged to greatly expand domestic fossil fuel production, overhaul Biden\u2019s clean energy initiatives, and withdraw the United States from major global climate efforts. Trump has said he will again withdraw the United States from the 2015 Paris Agreement , under which nearly two hundred countries agreed to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions to limit global temperature rise. Trump pulled the United States out of the deal in his first term, but Biden rejoined the agreement on his first day in office. Trump plans to press Congress to gut the Inflation Reduction Act , Biden\u2019s signature climate law that provides tax credits and subsidies\u00a0for electric vehicles and other clean energy products, criticizing it for being a major tax burden.\u00a0If reelected, he says he will \u201crescind all unspent funds\u201d under the legislation. He has pledged to remove permitting delays and other curbs on fossil fuel production, as well as significantly increase domestic drilling efforts, which he says will bring down inflation. The party platform pledges to \u201cunleash American energy\u201d and make the country fully energy independent. As president, he sought to open nearly all U.S. waters and protected lands to oil and gas drilling , as well as pressed for the construction of new oil pipelines using executive orders to streamline the permitting process. He says he will repeal Biden\u2019s pause on liquefied natural gas export terminal approvals if reelected. He supports nuclear energy and says he will invest more in small modular nuclear reactors. During his first term, his administration directed $1.3 billion to the first small-scale nuclear power project and established the National Reactor Innovation Center, which allows private companies to collaborate on reactor research and design. Trump spearheaded a broad reduction in environmental regulations, rolling back nearly one hundred federal rules , including requirements to reduce methane emissions, limit water pollution caused by fracking, and factor carbon emissions into federal decision-making. He has pledged to \u201csave\u201d the U.S. auto industry by rescinding new fuel economy standards implemented under Biden. While in office, he weakened former President Barack Obama\u2019s industry-wide automobile fuel-efficiency standards. Defense and NATO As president, Trump significantly increased defense spending and created a separate branch of the armed forces to address space competition. He also reoriented the United States\u2019 national security and defense strategy to focus on great-power competition with China and Russia and provoked European allies by threatening to abandon a Cold War-era mutual defense alliance. Trump says he will reassess the United States\u2019 role in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), a transatlantic defense alliance founded to counter the threat of a Soviet invasion during the Cold War, and would consider significantly reducing Washington\u2019s involvement with the bloc. He harshly criticized NATO while in office, reportedly telling top European officials in 2020 that \u201c NATO is dead ,\u201d and repeatedly threatened to abandon the alliance. He has long vocalized his opposition to NATO\u2019s collective defense clause, which stipulates that other NATO allies must come to the defense of a member country if it is attacked. He has often claimed that NATO countries are taking financial advantage of the United States by failing to meet a requirement that members spend at least 2 percent of their gross domestic product (GDP) on defense. He issued an updated missile defense plan in 2019, the first such review since 2010, which emphasized using new technologies and space-based systems to protect Washington and its allies. The 2024 platform calls for the construction of an \u201cIron Dome\u201d missile defense shield, a reference to Israel\u2019s missile defense system. That same year, he created a sixth branch of the U.S. Armed Forces, the U.S. Space Force, to combat the growing threat posed by strategic competitors in space. His administration\u2019s 2018 National Defense Strategy [PDF] stressed the strategic importance of the Asia-Pacific and European regions, with a particular focus on great-power competition with increasingly aggressive powers such as China and Russia. Trump achieved large increases in the U.S. defense budget, having pledged to rebuild the United States\u2019 \u201c depleted military .\u201d He signed a $700 billion budget in fiscal year 2018, the largest in history at the time, and the budget continued to grow under his administration, surpassing $740 billion in fiscal year 2021. Trump moved to reduce the U.S. troop presence abroad, including in Afghanistan. In 2020, he reached a withdrawal deal with the Taliban , which led Biden to fully end the two-decade U.S. military mission there in 2021. He has often criticized international organizations such as the International Criminal Court and the United Nations for undermining national security, and has said they should not have a say in U.S. defense and law enforcement policy. Inflation, Debt, and the Economy As president, Trump emphasized tax cutting and deregulatory economic policies, which he says spurred growth, innovation, and employment. His term saw a dramatic rise in the national debt due to COVID-19 pandemic-related and other spending, but now he says government spending needs \u201cmassive cuts\u201d to bring down inflation. Trump oversaw the passage of a 2017 bill that lowered the corporate tax rate from 35 to 21 percent, changed the way multinational firms are taxed, and lowered individual income tax rates, among many other provisions. Some of these provisions are set to expire in 2025 unless Congress reauthorizes them; the Republican platform calls for making them permanent. Trump has called for further lowering the corporate tax rate to 15 percent\u00a0for firms that make goods in the United States and eliminating taxes on tips and Social Security benefits. The latter proposal would add up to $1.8 trillion to the federal deficit over the next decade, according to some estimates . During his tenure, overall federal spending increased, the budget deficit grew , and the national debt continued its upward climb. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimated that the 2017 tax reform would add nearly $2 trillion in debt over the next ten years. Extending its expiring provisions would increase the debt by an additional $2.7 trillion. Meanwhile, a raft of emergency COVID-related spending measures added $3.6 trillion in additional costs when measured over ten years. Trump criticizes Biden for persistently high inflation, which he blames on Biden\u2019s \u201creckless\u201d spending, and for continuing to grow the deficit and the\u00a0national debt, which is now around equal to the country\u2019s GDP. He says Congress should take drastic steps to bring down spending, including by using the debt ceiling as a bargaining chip. However, he has opposed any cuts to the programs that make up the bulk of the budget, such as Social Security, Medicare, or defense. He implemented broad deregulation across the economy , including in the energy, financial, health, infrastructure, and agricultural sectors. He prioritized loosening oversight of Wall Street, signing a 2018 reform of the Dodd-Frank Act that lessens regulations on smaller banks. After some smaller firms that were no longer subject to Dodd-Frank rules collapsed in early 2023, Trump said he would not bail out failing banks. He wants to radically reduce the power and independence of federal agencies, which he says are responsible for a \u201cregulatory onslaught.\u201d He says he would refuse to spend congressionally appropriated money on programs with which he disagrees, and would bring independent federal regulators such as the Federal Trade Commission under his direct presidential authority. Global Health and Pandemic Prevention Trump oversaw the federal response to the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic, which included travel restrictions, widespread lockdowns, trillions of dollars of economic stimulus, and a private-public partnership to develop a vaccine. His administration\u2019s response was also characterized by an increasingly acrimonious debate over U.S. pandemic preparedness and response. In response to the outbreak, Trump declared a national emergency and restricted foreign travel to the United States. He also signed two major pieces of pandemic-related legislation that provided trillions of dollars of economic stimulus, including hundreds of billions of dollars in loans and grants to businesses. In May 2020, he launched Operation Warp Speed , a public-private partnership to streamline the process of developing a COVID-19 vaccine, which was first made available in 2021. The rapid development of such effective vaccines was unprecedented, driven by billions of dollars of investment by governments, multilateral organizations, and private firms. Trump referred to the disease as the \u201cChina virus,\u201d and has advanced the theory that it originated in a Chinese laboratory, one that has divided the U.S. intelligence community. He says China owes the world $10 trillion in compensation for its alleged role. In 2020, his administration froze funding to the World Health Organization (WHO), accusing it of \u201cseverely mismanaging\u201d the pandemic, and threatened to withdraw from the body . Trump criticized pandemic-related lockdowns and other restrictions, and he often challenged the projections and guidelines offered by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and other health agencies. Prior to the outbreak, his administration cut CDC staffing levels, including a team tasked with identifying health risks in China. If reelected, he promises to block any current or future COVID-19 mandates and \u201crestore medical freedom.\u201d Trump says he believes in exceptions to abortion restrictions for rape, incest, and threats to the mother\u2019s life. Like previous Republican presidents, Trump reinstated the so-called Mexico City policy that blocks abortion-related programs from receiving U.S. foreign aid, and expanded the measure\u2019s scope. The party platform opposes late-term abortion but says it will support access to prenatal care, birth control, and in vitro fertilization (IVF). Trump blames Biden\u2019s border policies for the worsening U.S. opioid epidemic . The party\u2019s platform calls for aggressive measures such as the deployment of the U.S. Navy to achieve a \u201cfull fentanyl blockade.\u201d Trump also promises to increase counternarcotics cooperation with neighboring governments such as Mexico, seek the death penalty for convicted drug dealers, and expand federal support for faith-based counseling, treatment, and recovery programs for drug users. Immigration and Border Security Immigration and border policy remain signature issues for Trump, and the party\u2019s 2024 platform renews his vows to implement a slew of measures to sharply reduce both legal and illegal immigration. This includes building upon actions taken during his first term to drastically reshape asylum, border, and deportation policy. Trump promises to implement \u201cthe largest domestic deportation operation in American history,\u201d modeled after President Dwight D. Eisenhower\u2019s mass deportations under the 1954 \u201c Operation Wetback .\u201d At his first debate with Harris, he said the Biden administration\u2019s immigration policies have allowed \u201cterrorists,\u201d \u201ccommon street criminals,\u201d and \u201cdrug dealers\u201d to enter the country. To do so, he says he will invoke the 1798 Alien Enemies Act \u2014one of four laws collectively known as the Alien and Sedition Acts\u2014to allow authorities to bypass due process to deport all known or suspected members of drug cartels or criminal gangs. He also plans to deputize the National Guard to carry out deportations, despite legal barriers to the military\u2019s ability to engage in domestic law enforcement. He has pledged to reimpose limits on seeking asylum , including by reinstating his 2019 \u201cRemain in Mexico\u201d program that required non-Mexican asylum seekers to wait in Mexico while their cases were heard in U.S. immigration courts. He has also said he would revive the use of Title 42, a law that allows border officials to expel migrants on public health grounds and which has only previously been used during the COVID-19 pandemic. He will seek to end birthright citizenship for children born to illegal immigrants, an idea he has advocated for since 2018. He has said he will expand his first-term travel ban on individuals from \u201cterror-plagued countries, territories, and places\u201d to include the Gaza Strip, Libya, Somalia, Syria, and Yemen. He also says he will bar those who hold certain viewpoints, including anti-Israel, Marxist, and fascist ideologies. In 2017, he imposed a ban on immigrants from several Muslim-majority countries that after several challenges was ultimately upheld by the Supreme Court. Trump says he will again suspend the United States\u2019 refugee resettlement program , roll back temporary protected status (TPS) designations for many countries, and tighten access to some visa programs , all of which he did in his first term. He will continue to press Congress for the adoption of a \u201cmerit-based\u201d immigration system aimed at protecting U.S. labor rather than the current arrangement that prioritizes family reunification. He has said he will continue construction of the wall along the southern U.S. border to keep out migrants. In 2019, he declared a national emergency that allowed him to divert funds to build out the barrier, which has continuously expanded since the 1990s. He will reportedly try again to end Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA), an Obama-era program that has provided deportation relief to hundreds of thousands of migrants brought to the United States illegally as children. The Supreme Court blocked his previous attempt on procedural grounds in 2020. Israel, Gaza, and the Middle East Trump\u2019s approach to the Middle East has been defined by strong support for Israel and Saudi Arabia, and a confrontational stance toward Iran. He points to his efforts to broker a regional peace deal and his focus on defeating Islamic terrorist groups such as the self-proclaimed Islamic State. Trump calls Israel a \u201ccherished ally.\u201d As president, Trump backed away from previous bipartisan consensus by saying he wasn\u2019t interested in a separate Palestinian state. Following the outbreak of war between Israel and Palestinian militant group Hamas in 2023, he promised to \u201cstand proudly\u201d with Israel. In 2017, he officially recognized Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and moved the U.S. Embassy there from Tel Aviv. In 2019, he recognized Israeli sovereignty over the disputed Golan Heights territory that Israel seized from Syria in 1967. Trump oversaw the Abraham Accords , a series of normalization deals between Israel and Arab countries. In January 2020, he released a new Middle East peace plan that would have awarded Israel sovereignty over much of the occupied Palestinian territories. Trump maintained close ties with Saudi Arabia, approving the sale of billions of dollars a year in arms to the kingdom, and has been a strong supporter of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. He vetoed bipartisan legislation that would have withdrawn U.S. support for Riyadh\u2019s military campaign in Yemen . He sought to influence the global oil supply through this relationship; amid the pandemic, Trump threatened to reduce military aid if the kingdom did not limit oil production. Trump\u2019s presidential term focused on isolating Iran, which he calls \u201cthe leading state sponsor of terrorism.\u201d He withdrew from the Iran nuclear deal in 2018 and reimposed sweeping economic sanctions on the country. In 2020, he ordered the assassination of Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps leader Qasem Soleimani. As one of his final decisions in office, he designated the Iran-backed , Yemen-based Houthi rebel movement as a foreign terrorist organization. Biden removed the designation before reinstating it in 2024 after the Houthis began attacking commercial ships in the Red Sea amid the Israel-Hamas war. Trump takes credit for the defeat of the Islamic State in Iraq at the hands of U.S. forces, while also pushing for troop withdrawals in Iraq and Syria. He has favored leaving some troops in Syria for access to its oil. Russia\u2013Ukraine Trump claims he could quickly resolve the war in Ukraine. He also says that he wouldn\u2019t commit to approving additional U.S. aid to Ukraine if reelected, saying European countries need to increase their own contributions. As president, he cultivated warmer relations with Russian President Vladimir Putin, though he also extended sanctions on Moscow over its annexation of Ukrainian territory and withdrew from a major U.S.-Russia arms control treaty. Trump says it is in the U.S. interest to end the war in Ukraine quickly as people were being killed \u201cby the millions,\u201d though he has said before that Putin\u2019s stated terms are not acceptable. He has previously called Putin \u201cgenius\u201d and \u201csavvy,\u201d but has also said that Putin \u201c made a tremendous mistake \u201d when he invaded Ukraine in February 2022. He has challenged bipartisan U.S. support for Ukraine, saying he would not commit to boosting military aid to the country if reelected. He says European countries need to step up their own contributions to Ukraine\u2019s defense. As president, Trump sought closer cooperation with Russia despite findings by the U.S. intelligence community that Moscow interfered in the 2016 presidential election. He repeatedly expressed criticism of the accusations alleging Russian interference, though he later accepted them . His administration maintained Obama-era sanctions imposed on Russia after its 2014 annexation of Crimea and expanded sanctions on Russian individuals and firms, focusing on malign cyber activity, election interference, and Russia\u2019s support for autocratic countries such as North Korea and Venezuela. In 2019, Trump withdrew the United States from the 1987 Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty that eliminated U.S. and Russian stocks of intermediate- and short-range missiles, claiming that Russia was in violation . He has said he wants to form a new nuclear pact with Russia that would include China as well. He also withdrew from the 2002 Open Skies Treaty , which allowed unarmed surveillance flights over Russia and most of Europe. In 2019, he faced his first impeachment inquiry after House lawmakers accused him of withholding military aid to the Ukrainian government to pressure it to investigate Joe Biden and his family over their alleged involvement in Ukrainian politics. Trump was later acquitted. Trade Trump argues that the global trading system is rigged against U.S. interests and responsible for large trade deficits, declining U.S. manufacturing, and the offshoring of American jobs. The Republican platform promises to return the United States to the \u201cmanufacturing superpower of the world\u201d through \u201crebalancing trade\u201d towards domestic production. Trump has pledged to impose a \u201cuniversal\u201d tariff on most imports while matching higher tariffs imposed by other countries on U.S. products, as well as additional tariffs on countries who seek an alternative to the U.S. dollar. He has called this approach \u201can eye for an eye, a tariff for a tariff.\u201d As president, Trump renegotiated the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), which he has called \u201cone of the worst trade deals ever made.\u201d The updated agreement made with U.S. neighbors in 2018, known as the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, includes tariff-free access to the U.S. market for most Canadian and Mexican products. Post-election, Trump said he would impose a 25 percent tariff on all imports from Canada and Mexico until they meet demands to halt illegal immigration and the flow of drugs, particularly fentanyl. He outlined a separate plan for an additional 10 percent tariff on Chinese goods; he had previously proposed 60 percent. He has vowed to end the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework (IPEF), a trade initiative between the United States and Asia-Pacific region, \u201con day one.\u201d Trump withdrew the United States from IPEF\u2019s predecessor, the more ambitious Trans-Pacific Partnership (TTP), on his first day in office in 2017. He has called IPEF \u201cTTP Two.\u201d Trump also renegotiated a trade deal with South Korea, withdrew from trade talks with the European Union (EU), and imposed broad-based tariffs on steel and aluminum imports, including from EU countries and other allies. Biden eased many of these restrictions. China was a major target of Trump\u2019s trade restrictions. As president, he imposed tariffs on $360 billion worth of Chinese goods, which Biden has maintained. Trump has said he would sharply raise these tariffs and outright prohibit U.S. investment in China as well as Chinese purchases of U.S. assets. He also says he would \u201cphase out\u201d imports of Chinese-made electronics, steel, and pharmaceuticals and seek to terminate privileges China gained when it joined the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 2000. Trump has called the WTO a \u201cdisaster,\u201d and threatened to withdraw from the body. He accuses China and other members of abusing WTO rules that give developing countries more flexibility.

Published March 10, 2025 Rebecca Pifer Senior Reporter post share post print email license President Donald Trump addresses reporters during a press briefing at the White House on March 3, 2025. Andrew Harnik via Getty Images Listen to the article 15 min This audio is auto-generated. Please let us know if you have feedback . Healthcare companies struggling to adopt artificial intelligence amid a lack of federal standards are unlikely to get any help from the Trump administration, placing the burden of responsible implementation squarely on the industry\u2019s shoulders. That mandate is becoming increasingly difficult as the technology grows more complex, experts said during the HIMSS healthcare conference in Las Vegas. \u201cOne thing that\u2019s clear is that this administration is not going to regulate AI. Good or bad, take that for what it is,\u201d\u00a0T anay T andon , the CEO of provider automation company Commure, said during a panel. President Donald Trump\u2019s hands-off approach to AI governance means hospitals turning to the tools to save money and give overworked clinicians some relief will likely be operating in a regulatory gray area for at least the next four years. The president says his goal is to free up U.S. developers to innovate. But that comes with downsides for tech developers and healthcare companies desperate for guardrails given AI\u2019s proclivity to make mistakes, degrade over time and exacerbate existing bias. Not to mention, a lack of national standards might actually hamper AI development and adoption, according to some experts. \u201cWhen there isn\u2019t a federal framework, it can just absolutely cause all kinds of problems,\u201d said Leigh Burchell, the chair of the Electronic Health Records Association. \u201cWe all just want to know what our rules are. And then we can comply.\u201d Biden versus Trump on health AI To date, a handful of federal agencies, including the HHS\u2019 technology office , the CMS and the Food and Drug Administration, have published targeted rules around the use and quality of AI in healthcare. But neither Congress nor the executive branch have zeroed in on a comprehensive framework to regulate the models \u2014 despite some progress during the Biden administration, when an HHS task force was working to build a unified regulatory structure. That task force unveiled a strategic plan in January \u2014\u00a0just 10 days before Trump\u2019s inauguration. However, Trump nixed the blueprint in one of his first executive orders. Meanwhile, federal employees working on AI oversight, including at the FDA, have been caught up in the Trump administration\u2019s purge of the government\u2019s workforce. Amid the turmoil, the future of the HHS office that oversees AI policy remains unclear. As a result, what little momentum there was in Washington to create a concrete strategy for overseeing health AI appears to have stalled out, at least for now. In its place, Trump has announced the Stargate Project , a $500 billion investment deal with private companies to prioritize AI development and maintain U.S. supremacy in the space \u2014\u00a0a high-stakes bet that was immediately complicated by the release of DeepSeek , a high-performing and inexpensive open source model from China. \"The current administration \u2014\u00a0the brakes have come off and the accelerator has come down.\" Brian Spisak Program director of AI and leadership, Harvard University's National Preparedness Leadership Initiative The Trump administration did issue a request for information in early February to get public input on a potential national AI action plan. However, the plan\u2019s wording makes clear the administration\u2019s priorities: to \u201csustain and enhance America\u2019s AI dominance, and to ensure that unnecessarily burdensome requirements do not hamper private sector AI innovation.\u201d The revocation of the Biden-era AI plan was largely symbolic, as agencies hadn\u2019t yet gotten around to imposing any requirements on developers or users. But in \u201cthe current administration \u2014\u00a0the brakes have come off and the accelerator has come down,\u201d said Brian Spisak, program director of AI and leadership at Harvard University's National Preparedness Leadership Initiative, at HIMSS. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of responsibility to leadership of health systems to find the optimal balance between innovation and speed and safety and tradition.\u201d A technological sea change That responsibility \u2014 which also rests on AI developers creating the models, software vendors weaving them into health records and the clinicians using them \u2014\u00a0is not negligible. Currently, even the most futuristic AI at healthcare institutions is being used to automate administration, and only peripherally touches patient care. But that appears to be changing: There\u2019s growing interest among medical organizations in more clinical use cases for AI, like tailoring treatment plans or helping clinicians arrive at a diagnosis, according to a survey from HIMSS conducted in the fall. Many of those use cases involve generative AI, which can create original text and images. But such models are known to hallucinate , or provide answers that are factually incorrect or irrelevant. AI can leave important information out, an error known as omission. Models can also drift, a term for when an AI\u2019s performance changes or degrades over time. Given the increasing prevalence of AI in pulling data from EHR systems,\u00a0transcribing doctor-patient visits and more, errors like these could interfere with clinicians\u2019 ability to care for patients, experts say. Meanwhile, the technology is advancing at a stunning rate. Last year, the healthcare industry was just beginning to come to terms with governance for generative AI. But now, the conversation has already moved onto AI agents, which can complete complex tasks largely unsupervised by humans. The HIMSS health IT conference in March in Las Vegas, where a number of companies touted AI agents. Courtesy of HIMSS Commure\u2019s Tanay equated the current moment to when America moved from kerosene to electricity at the end of the 19th century. \u201cThe way that we did things six months ago is completely irrelevant,\u201d he said. Because of the breakneck speed of development, federal standards from any administration would likely need to be flexible, experts say. The Biden administration\u2019s HHS task force suggested the government could create guidelines around testing and piloting tools, along with some support for adoption. However, it shied away from a prescriptive approach. That\u2019s in line with the wish list from many stakeholders. Numerous executives at tech companies and hospital systems said any federal standards should be stratified by the level of risk an AI model imposes \u2014 for example, stricter oversight for algorithms that help doctors diagnose diseases, and looser restrictions for algorithms that help hospital staff allocate patients to beds. \u201cWe have to weigh the balance between underregulation, which can potentially increase risk, and overregulation, which will stunt innovation,\u201d said Anthony Chang, the chief intelligence and innovation officer at the Children\u2019s Hospital of Orange County in California, during a panel. \u201cThe current administration is more likely to be on the underregulation side. So we have to be careful as a profession that we don\u2019t allow that to happen,\u201d Chang said. States, industry groups filling the void The lack of a playbook from Washington has left hospitals and medical groups scrambling to build their own internal controls amid a patchwork of state laws and voluntary standards released by industry groups. States including Colorado , Utah and California have already enacted legislation establishing disclaimer requirements for AI systems. More states are considering similar laws: The Electronic Health Records Association is tracking 150 different state bills related to health AI, according to Burchell. \u201cThere is a massive explosion of bills,\u201d Burchell said. But differing standards could stop health AI developers and software companies from rolling out products in specific states,\u00a0potentially disadvantaging patients depending on where they live. More risk-averse software companies may avoid AI, or certain states, altogether, she added. \u201cLegislation of a lot of sizes and shapes at the state level is a risk to us, because it means we have to do all kinds of different development. We would rather develop one system that can be used broadly and accepted across the country,\u201d Burchell said. Health AI standards groups are also stepping into the gap left by the federal government. The groups \u2014\u00a0often made up of leading hospitals, digital health companies and tech giants \u2014\u00a0include the Health AI Partnership, an AI learning network for the industry, and the Coalition for Health AI, which recently launched an AI registry for hospitals . \u201dI think we\u2019ll probably see more of these non-government organizations like Health AI Partnership and some of those emerge as maybe our north stars today, as here\u2019s some leadership in the space,\u201d said Rachel Wilkes, the corporate lead for generative AI initiatives at EHR vendor Meditech. But standards from industry consortia hold little weight without the heft of the federal government behind them, experts say. Historically, voluntary standards aren\u2019t particularly effective. \u201cThere\u2019s room for people to act in their own best interest, whatever that may be, without any sort of federal framework,\u201d Wilkes said. \u2018We still don\u2019t quite know how to deal with it\u2019 EHR vendors and hospital operators say they\u2019re building up rigorous internal standards for AI tools, including validation and frequent auditing. \u201cGovernment oversight has its place, but I do think the way that clinical practice evolves tends to be more driven by what\u2019s happening at a health system,\u201d said Seth Howard, the executive vice president of research and development for Epic, the largest EHR company in the U.S. In interviews, executives with Epic, Oracle, Meditech and eClinicalWorks said they\u2019re making AI available to doctors with rigorous oversight,\u00a0including back-end accuracy checks and ongoing monitoring. However, tech leaders stressed that it\u2019s also the hospital and the clinicians\u2019 responsibility to make sure everything is working as planned. \u201cWe are working in an industry that deals with human life. It cannot be trivial. It cannot be under-exaggerated on what guardrails and checks and balances and what discussions need to happen,\u201d said Girish Navani, the CEO of eClinicalWorks. Technology behemoths betting heavily on AI feel similarly. Google, for example, has worked with for-profit hospital giant HCA on an evaluation framework to catch any errors generated by its AI models and ensure their reliability, according to Aashima Gupta , the head of healthcare for Google Cloud. \u201cWe provide those tools for an evaluation framework, and for all of this there\u2019s a human in the loop capturing the feedback, and that feedback loop then makes the model more effective,\u201d Gupta said. \u201cThat\u2019s what gives me comfort.\u201d \"We are working in an industry that deals with human life. It cannot be trivial. It cannot be under-exaggerated on what guardrails and checks and balances and what discussions need to happen.\" Girish Navani CEO, eClinicalWorks Though some in the private sector say they\u2019ve got governance handled, modern AI is incredibly hard to oversee, according to AI engineers. The main advantage of generative AI \u2014 its creativity \u2014 also introduces subjectivity, making grading its outputs complicated. For example,\u00a0if two clinicians are tasked to summarize a patient\u2019s medical history based on clinical notes, their results could be incredibly different, albeit still accurate. It\u2019s the same with generative AI, experts say: How do you measure quality in a standardized way when there\u2019s that degree of variability? \u201cAI governance is still very much a maturing process,\u201d said Harvard\u2019s Spisak. Hospital executives say they\u2019re tackling oversight carefully. But some research suggests governance systems for simpler predictive AI models already aren\u2019t rigorous enough. H ospitals with explicit procedures for the use and assessment of AI tools are still struggling to identify and mitigate problems, according to a study published last year in the New England Journal of Medicine. A patient receives an exam in a room equipped with ambient listening AI technology to transcribe the interaction. Permission granted by Nuance Communications Even some of the most well-resourced and tech-savvy systems are struggling. The Cleveland Clinic has an AI governing body that includes stakeholders from across the academic medical center, according to Rohit Chandra, the Cleveland Clinic\u2019s chief digital officer. The task force oversees AI\u2019s impact on the organization\u2019s patients and workers while ensuring clinical safety and discussing thorny questions of privacy, legality and bias. But \u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019ve figured it all out,\u201d Chandra said during a panel. \u201cThe term hallucination, for one, has just shown up in the last two, three years. And we still don\u2019t quite know how to deal with it.\u201d Hospitals should try to make specific people accountable for the performance of the tools,\u00a0as part of a larger governing body that includes executives, lawyers, doctors and nurses, according to Brenton Hill, the head of operations at standards group CHAI. Hospitals need to decide how to monitor AI effectively and report that information, which can depend on the products they have in place. They also need to consider what resources the AI will use and develop appropriate data use agreements with AI vendors, Hill said during a panel. But \u201cthere\u2019s not one silver bullet governance structure that you can put out there that will solve all your problems,\u201d Hill said. \u2018A pipe dream\u2019 Though a road map from federal regulators would be helpful, stakeholders working to integrate AI tools into healthcare said they\u2019re not holding their breath. \u201cWhile self-regulation is good, we don\u2019t believe that\u2019s sufficient. We believe AI is too important not to be regulated,\u201d said Google\u2019s Gupta. But when asked what she expects from the Trump administration, Gupta was noncommittal. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to say at this point. We are trying to figure out how we best work with them,\u00a0share our best practices with them ... Too early to say. I think the entire healthcare community is waiting for that,\u201d Gupta said. Other experts said the Trump administration is a wake-up call for hospital executives who believed Washington could assume responsibility for overseeing AI. Instead, the mandate should be on everyone touching the technology to ensure AI algorithms \u2014 given their shifting nature and innate opacity \u2014 perform as they\u2019re designed, especially in an industry where any mistakes could impact patient health. \u201cThe easy answer is, if this regulatory body says it\u2019s safe, then I can trust it. I think people were hoping that might happen for AI,\u201d said Aaron Neinstein, the chief medical officer of agentic AI company Notable. \u201cI think that was a pipe dream.\u201d Recommended Reading Could artificial intelligence increase clinician burden?

Dominic Waghorn International affairs editor @DominicWaghorn Monday 10 March 2025 13:45, UK Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player 14:13 Sky News's international affairs correspondent Dominic Waghorn reports on how Donald Trump's tumultuous first 50 days in office has affected people around the world Why you can trust Sky News In just 50 days, Donald Trump has upended our world. He has ripped up rules, attacked allies and sided with enemies. A country we thought for decades had our backs is no longer a reliable partner. We travelled thousands of miles to ask what that means for our lives and millions of others - from the sweltering backstreets of Africa to the frozen wastes of Greenland and Finland's tense border with Russia. Donald Trump ' s supporters at home and abroad see him as the disruptor-in-chief who will bring peace and prosperity, putting America first. But to many others we found he threatens chaos and a far darker future. While Mr Trump may be challenging convention and bringing fresh thinking, his critics say he is moving too fast and erratically. His first 50 days in office, they claim, have weakened America's place in the world and that will be exploited by rivals. Risk of resurgent epidemics in Kenya We went first to Kenya . The focus in the West may have been on Mr Trump and Russia but in the developing world, it's the end of US aid that is grabbing the headlines. On the frontlines of Africa's war on HIV we heard Mr Trump's actions being compared to an act of \"biological warfare\". Even among allies and admirers of the American president, there is deep unease and fear about what could come next, most of all the risk of resurgent epidemics of diseases like HIV, TB, malaria, ebola, and polio. Image: A street in one of Kenya's poorest neighbourhoods in Nairobi In one of Kenya's poorest neighbourhoods in Nairobi, we joined health workers on their rounds, down sewage-filled alleyways into cramped, overcrowded buildings. In a one-room home, we met a young mother who is dependent on American aid. Anne is HIV positive and needs daily medication and nutritional support for both herself and her one-year-old son. She is terrified for their future because of the cut in US aid. Image: Anne, who is HIV positive, with her young child Image: An alleyway of one-room homes in Nairobi \"I'm so worried,\" she told us, \"because if it carries on like this the medication could run out. When the medicine is not there, the protector of my body is not there, so anything can just pass through me.\" 'We had no warning' Kenya received $850m (\u00a3658m) in aid a year and that has now been abruptly severed. A US Supreme Court decision against the Trump administration may restore some of that but there is complete uncertainty about what happens next. Martha, a healthcare manager in Nairobi, spelled out what is at stake: \"We had no warning. We could not prepare the households. It was so sudden. Image: Martha, a healthcare manager in Nairobi \"We expect more death. We expect more children to die before the age of five. We expect more death for children living with HIV and it is going to be bad,\" Martha said, adding that more than 20,000 children who use her organisation's services will be affected. 83% of all US aid contracts cut The Trump administration says the aid has been only been suspended for 90 days pending a review. But in reality, many key programmes appear to have been shut down completely. After a 45-minute flight west of Nairobi to Kisumu, we saw what is happening away from big cities. The impact seemed just as severe. At one provincial hospital US Agency for International Development (USAID) signs were everywhere but on doors that are now shut. It had been a hub for patients to receive their treatment but that's now in doubt. Image: A health worker delivering medication in Kisumu Image: Kisumu, Kenya Staff told us there were just two months of supplies left for some medication, and less than a month for others, because there have been no more deliveries. Patients were stockpiling drugs, said doctors, panicking for the future. 'Biological warfare' The US-supplied ammunition for Africa's war against HIV, malaria, TB and other diseases is running out. It has taken decades and billions to bring them under control. The fear is of a return to epidemics not seen for years. Image: A sign thanking the American people in the hospital in Kisumu Image: Deliveries of medication supplied by USAID in the Kisumu hospital Eric Okioma is HIV positive and runs a charity helping others with the disease in Kisumu. \"When you look at it from a public health aspect, that's biological warfare that's the way I'm seeing it because from a human rights perspective, he did the wrong thing - he should not have taken it abruptly.\" Image: Eric Okioma, who runs a charity helping others HIV in Kisumu Mr Trump is popular among many in Kenya. His conservative stance on issues like gender and sexuality resonates in this predominantly Christian country. But even among admirers and supporters there is deep unease about his aid cut. Peter Gunday, a father and churchgoer, told us he agreed Kenya should be less dependent on US aid and encouraged to provide for itself - but Mr Trump's action had been too sudden. \"He wants to make America great again... [but give an] olive branch to us even if it is only for some time.\" Image: Peter Gunday, a churchgoer in Kisumu The aid cut threatens lives and America's standing in the world. The US has used aid to wield soft power and influence. Read more: US aid crisis leaves South Africans living with HIV in turmoil What is USAID? America in retreat Its superpower rival China prefers building. They have lent billions for massive infrastructure projects like the new railway from Nairobi to the coast through the heart of the city's safari park. For Beijing it's all leverage, applied ruthlessly to increase access to Africa's abundant natural resources. Image: One of the new Chinese-built roads in Kenya Under Trump, America is unilaterally deserting that battle for power and influence. Its values and interests will inevitably suffer. Not so much America first but America in retreat. Finland prepares for Russian aggression Closer to home, it is America's shift on security causing the greatest concern. We flew thousands of miles north to one of NATO 's newest member countries that sits on a border with Russia. What did people in Finland make of what Mr Trump is doing to the Western alliance they have only just joined? We filmed with Finland 's military on the border with Russia that was closed because of the war in Ukraine. Image: On Finland's border with Russia In sparsely populated woods, locals report sightings of Russian drones, we were told. And there has been a surge in recruits to the border guard because of the international situation. One of them, Aku Jaeske, told us he had joined up \"for the defence of our own country\". Image: Aku Jaeske He said: \"I think most of us, I think, are here because of that. It's really hard if we have a 1,300 and something kilometre border with Russia - it's pretty long - we have to have good men there.\" 'Bring it on', says one Finn What did he make of Mr Trump and what he saw on the news? \"I think it's crazy when you turn your TV on today, you can't know what is really happening.\" The war with Ukraine and Russia's belligerence has sparked a boom in shooting, with hundreds of new ranges opening up in Finland to meet demand. In a range outside Helsinki, one shooting enthusiast Jerkri told us what he thought was behind its growing popularity. Image: Jerkri says shooting has become popular in Finland because 'people are noticing maybe [they are] to take care of themselves' Image: Inside one of Finland's growing number of shooting ranges \"The situation in Ukraine and people are noticing that maybe [they are] having to take care of themselves... think about it.\" Amateur shooters go through their paces, crisscrossing an open range at speed firing at targets dotted around the room. Patrick said he was worried by the direction of events. \"But if it did come to it... bring it on,\" he said. Image: Patrick says 'bring it on' in response to a question on having to use his shooting skills in the future In a service station, Finland's most popular tabloid had the headline, \"Trump's 10 gifts to Putin.\" Finns were once a byword for peace-loving neutrality. They are arming up now, and watching Mr Trump's overtures to the Kremlin warily. Finland after all is where Mr Trump stood next to Russian President Vladimir Putin during his first term in office and infamously said he would believe him over the word of US spy agencies. US may be deserting the West The Finns know from their history a belligerent Russia cannot be trusted. In Europe, the US is not just withdrawing under Donald Trump, who says the US cannot prioritise the continent's security any longer. It looks like it may be changing sides deserting the West entirely: Cutting off aid and intelligence to Ukraine while it is pummelled by Russian rockets and drones; branding Ukraine's leader - and not the tyrant of Moscow - a dictator; attacking close allies with tariffs; resetting relations with Russia while it continues to invade a part of Europe. 'Trump is ridiculous', Greenlanders say And threatening to take over its neighbours. Our journey ended in Greenland , top of the list of Mr Trump's planned acquisitions. Most people we spoke to were genuinely worried by him. Image: Nuuk, the capital of Greenland Students Aviana and Julie told us Mr Trump's antics were alarming. \"That's very scary actually - it seems he's more with Russia than Ukraine. I'm really scared.\" Image: Students Aviana and Julie said they were scared by Trump's actions Another passerby said Mr Trump had no right to make a play for their homeland. They said: \"I think it's ridiculous that he thinks he can just take our land. We don't have the resources to fight against the USA.\" Jurgen Boassen has become a well-known figure for having opposing views - he is outspokenly pro-Trump. Image: Jurgen Boassen, who is pro-Trump and is paid by MAGA groups to promote 'cultural ties' between Greenland and the US \"I think he is a great man who wants to have peace in the world,\" he told us. 'Europe is failing' He admits he is paid by MAGA groups in America to promote \"cultural ties\" and believes Greenland will gradually come around to the idea of becoming closer to America. Image: Ice caps in Greenland \"I don't care because they will realise I'm doing the good thing for Greenland. Europe is failing, Britain, Sweden, Belgium, Holland even Germany,\" he said. Wherever we travelled people seemed in shock. America used to believe helping others was good for America - keeping the peace in Europe, saving lives, or protecting the sovereignty of neighbours.

The idea Mr Trump could carve up the world into spheres of influence with other authoritarian leaders seems plausible. If that is the case, lesser nations like Greenland may have plenty to fear. From what we were told on our journey, Donald Trump's America First foreign policy risks the lives of millions, the security and sovereignty of allies, and America's own place in the world while potentially strengthening its enemies.
