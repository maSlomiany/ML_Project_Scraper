Andrzej Duda, Poland,en,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrzej_Duda,"President of Poland since 2015

Andrzej Sebastian Duda[a] (born 16 May 1972) is a Polish lawyer and politician who has been the sixth and current president of Poland since 2015. Before becoming president, he served as Member of the Sejm (MP) from 2011 to 2014 and as Member of the European Parliament (MEP) from 2014 to 2015.

Duda was the presidential candidate for the Law and Justice party (PiS) during the presidential election in May 2015. In the first round of voting, he received 5,179,092 votes – 34.76% of valid votes. In the second round of voting, he received 51.55% of the vote, beating the incumbent president Bronisław Komorowski, who received 48.45% of the vote. On 26 May 2015, Duda resigned his party membership as the president-elect.

On 24 October 2019, he received the official support of PiS ahead of his re-election campaign in 2020. He finished first in the first round and then went on to defeat Rafał Trzaskowski in the runoff with 10,440,648 votes or 51.03% of the vote.[1] Throughout his first and second terms, Duda has largely aligned himself with the right-wing ideologies espoused by PiS and its leader Jarosław Kaczyński. Following the Russian invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, Duda has played an important role in coordinating international efforts to support Ukraine's military.[2]

Early life and education [ edit ]

Duda was born on 16 May 1972 in Kraków, to Janina (Milewska) and Jan Tadeusz Duda, professors at the AGH University of Science and Technology. His grandfather fought in the Polish–Soviet War and later was a member of the Home Army during the Second World War.[3]

Between 1987 and 1991, Duda attended Jan III Sobieski High School, Kraków, where he excelled in Humanities.[4] He subsequently studied law at the Jagiellonian University, and earned a law degree. In 2001, he was appointed as a research assistant in the Department of Administrative Law of the Jagiellonian University's Faculty of Law and Administration. In January 2005, Duda earned a Doctor of Law degree (LL.D.) at the Jagiellonian University. Due to his political career, he has been mostly on unpaid leave from the university since September 2006, except for a 13-month interval beginning in September 2010, when he returned to the university.[5] Additionally, he was a lecturer at Mieszko I College of Education and Administration, Poznań.[6]

Political career [ edit ]

Duda began his political career with the now defunct Freedom Union Party in the early 2000s. After the parliamentary elections in 2005, he began his collaboration with the Law and Justice Party (PiS).[7] He was an undersecretary of state in the Ministry of Justice between 2006 and 2007 before becoming a member of Polish State Tribunal from 2007 until 2008.

From 2008 to 2010, during the presidency of Lech Kaczyński, Duda was an undersecretary of state in the Chancellery of the President.[8] In 2010, he was an unsuccessful candidate to become the Mayor of Kraków as a PiS candidate,[9] but was more successful in the 2011 parliamentary election, where he received 79,981 votes for the Kraków area, and thus became a member of the Sejm.[10]

In September 2013, the news magazine Polityka commended Duda for being one of the most active members of parliament, describing him as being open to opposition arguments and as refraining from personal attacks, as part of his role at the Commission for Constitutional Responsibility.[11] Duda remained a member of the Sejm until he was elected to the European Parliament in 2014.[12]

2015 presidential campaign [ edit ]

As Bronisław Komorowski's presidential term was expiring, Komorowski was able to seek re-election in a scheduled presidential election. Duda was Komorowski's Law and Justice rival in the election.

In the first round of the 2015 presidential election, Duda came first, receiving 5,179,092 votes and thus 34.76% of valid votes.[13]

In the second round Duda took 51.55% of the vote against the 48.45% share of his rival, the incumbent president Bronisław Komorowski.[14] On 26 May 2015, he officially resigned from party membership;[15] recent precedent calls for the president to not be a formal member of a political party.

2020 presidential campaign [ edit ]

In the first round of the 2020 presidential election, Duda appeared to come in first, receiving almost 44% of the votes. Warsaw mayor Rafał Trzaskowski came in second, with just over 30% of the vote. The second round took place on 12 July.[16] Duda won reelection.[17]

Presidency (2015–present) [ edit ]

The first five-year term of Andrzej Duda began on 6 August 2015 with taking an oath of office during a National Assembly session.[18]

Duda rejected the European Union's proposal of migrant quotas to redistribute asylum seekers, saying: ""I won't agree to a dictate of the strong. I won't back a Europe where the economic advantage of the size of a population will be a reason to force solutions on other countries regardless of their national interests"".[19]

In September 2015 Prime Minister Ewa Kopacz declared that Poland, as an expression of ""European solidarity"", would take in 2,000 people over the next two years, mainly from Syria and Eritrea (out of 3,700 originally requested).[20]

Duda and Croatian President Kolinda Grabar-Kitarović were the originators of the Three Seas Initiative.[21]

Duda repeatedly met with general secretary of the Chinese Communist Party, Xi Jinping,[22][23] stating that ""Polish companies will benefit hugely"" from China's Belt and Road Initiative.[24] Duda and Xi signed a declaration on strategic partnership in which they reiterated that Poland and China viewed each other as long-term strategic partners.[25] Duda said that he hopes Poland will become a gateway to Europe for China.[26]

In September 2017, his approval rating stood at 71% and in February 2018, at 72%, a record surpassed only by Aleksander Kwaśniewski, whose approval ratings surpassed 75% from 1995 to 2005.[27][28]

On 6 June 2023, Duda presented three goals of Poland's presidency in the European Union in the first half of 2025. The first goal is to deepen transatlantic cooperation and strengthen the relationship between the European Union and the United States. The second goal is to further expand the community to include Ukraine, Moldova, and the Western Balkans, and in the future, other aspiring countries as well. The third goal will be to enhance Europe's energy security.[29]

In 2024, Duda criticised plans by Prime Minister Donald Tusk to suspend the right to asylum in Poland by irregular migrants, calling it a ""fatal mistake"" that would also affect dissidents from Russia and Belarus.[30]

Pardon of Mariusz Kamiński [ edit ]

In November 2015, on the basis of Article 139 of the Constitution of Poland, Duda pardoned former Central Anticorruption Bureau (CBA) head Mariusz Kamiński and three CBA officers convicted by a court of 1st instance in the so-called ""Land Affair"" [pl],[31] marking the first pardon granted by a president before reaching a final verdict. [32] According to some lawyers (including professors Jan Zimmermann – Andrzej Duda's doctorate promoter, Leszek Kubicki – former Minister of Justice and Andrzej Zoll – former president of the Constitutional Tribunal) Duda acted in violation of the Constitution of Poland.[33][34][35]

Constitutional crisis [ edit ]

Andrzej Duda refused to swear in any of the five Constitutional Tribunal judge candidates selected by the Sejm of the VII term. Three of them had been selected since 7 November 2015 whose election was declared constitutional.[36] Between 3 and 9 December 2015, Duda swore in five other candidates for the same office selected by the Sejm of the VIII term.[37][38]

On 28 December 2015, Duda signed the Constitutional Tribunal bill (passed on 22 December 2015 by the Sejm), which unequivocally breaches the Constitution of Poland according to the National Council of the Judiciary of Poland,[39] the Public Prosecutor General[40] and the Polish Ombudsman.[41]

In July 2017, Duda informed the public he had decided to veto two controversial judicial bills backed by the government and passed by both houses of the Polish parliament. The President's spokesman subsequently said that the third act – the common courts bill – would be signed.[42] The veto was just one example of Duda opposing the policies of PiS.[43]

Politics of memory and the Holocaust [ edit ]

In February 2018, Duda said that he would sign into law the Amendment to the Act on the Institute of National Remembrance, making it illegal to accuse 'the Polish nation' of complicity in the Holocaust and other Nazi German atrocities, a measure that has roiled relations with Israel, with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu going as far as accusing the Polish government of ""Holocaust denial"".[44][45][46]

In September 2022, Duda and his wife attended the funeral of Holocaust survivor Edward Mosberg in the United States, and Duda announced that he was awarding Mosberg the Grand Cross of the Order of Merit of the Republic of Poland, the highest Polish award in its class.[47] He awarded it in recognition of Mosberg's achievements in advancing Polish-Jewish dialogue and developing cooperation between nations, and for preserving the memory of and communicating what happened in the Holocaust.[47]

Stance on LGBT rights [ edit ]

In June 2020, Duda said that he would not allow gay couples to marry or adopt children, while describing the LGBT movement as ""a foreign ideology"" and comparing it to indoctrination in the Soviet Union. He also pledged he would ban LGBT teaching in schools.[48][49][50][51] In response to Duda's comments, former Prime Minister of Belgium Elio Di Rupo publicly asked the European Commission for an official reaction.[52][53][54] Soon after his comments, Duda invited presidential candidate Robert Biedroń (who had asked to meet the president)[55] and an LGBT activist, Bartosz Staszewski, to the Presidential Palace,[56][57] though Robert Biedroń eventually turned down the invitation, refusing to meet President Duda until he apologized.[58] According to Staszewski, during their meeting Duda cited freedom of speech to defend his words about ""LGBT ideology"".[56]

On 4 July 2020, Duda proposed changing the constitution to ban LGBT couples from adopting children. On 6 July 2020, he signed a document with a presidential draft of the amendment to the Polish Constitution.[59][60][61]

Foreign policy [ edit ]

In October 2017, he met with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan and supported Turkey's accession to the European Union.[63]

U.S. President Donald Trump praised Duda, saying: ""He's doing a terrific job.""[64][65] In September 2019, Trump and Duda agreed to send 1,000 U.S. troops to Poland.[66]

On 24 June 2020, Trump said at a press conference with Duda that the United States planned to move some U.S. troops from Germany to Poland.[67][68] Trump said that ""Poland is one of the few countries that are fulfilling their obligations under NATO — in particular, their monetary obligations — and they asked us if we would send some additional troops. They're going to pay for that.""[69]

In February 2022, Duda attended the opening ceremony of the Olympic Winter Games in Beijing and met with Chinese President Xi Jinping. Some Polish diplomats criticised Duda's visit to China because some of Poland's Western allies boycotted the Winter Olympics in China due to the alleged Uyghur genocide and other human rights abuses in China.[70]

In October 2022, Duda declared that Poland would be willing to host U.S. nuclear weapons.[71]

In March 2023, Duda visited gas-rich Qatar and the United Arab Emirates. He focused on energy security and cooperation.[72]

On 7 October 2023, he condemned Hamas' actions during the Israel–Hamas war and expressed his support to Israel and its right to self-defense.[73]

On 9 January 2025, Duda asked Prime Minister Donald Tusk and his government to guarantee safe passage for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to travel to an event marking the 80th anniversary of the liberation of the Auschwitz concentration camp by Soviet troops, despite Netanyahu facing an arrest warrant from the International Criminal Court for Israeli war crimes in the Gaza war.[74] In response, Tusk guaranteed safe passage for Netanyahu.[75]

Lex Tusk [ edit ]

On 29 May 2023, during a press conference, Duda announced the intention to sign the ""Lex Tusk"", a law establishing a commission to investigate Russian influence in Poland. According to the law, the commission is expected to publish its first report in September before the parliamentary elections. The law reached the president's desk after the Sejm rejected the Senate's veto on the matter on 26 May. The Senate recommended the rejection of the law in its entirety due to its anti-democratic nature, numerous errors, and 13 potential violations of the constitution.[76][77] On 7 June 2023, the European Commission initiated legal proceedings against Poland regarding the extensively debated law. Brussels was concerned that the law might be used to target opposition politicians in the country's general election which was scheduled, and took place, in late 2023.[78][79]

Personal life [ edit ]

Duda is married to Agata Kornhauser-Duda, a teacher of German at Jan III Sobieski High School in Kraków.[80] They met as high school students, at a party.[3] The couple have been married since 21 December 1994.[81] They have one daughter named Kinga (b. 1995).[82] Duda's father-in-law is Julian Kornhauser, a well-known writer, translator and literary critic.[83]

Duda is a keen skier, and he participated in the Polish Academic Championships in Alpine skiing while he was a university student.[3]

Duda is a practising Roman Catholic. He took part in religious ceremonies on many occasions, including Midnight Mass, the blessing of food on Holy Saturday, and the Corpus Christi procession in Kraków.[84][85][86]

""Joseph Biden"" and ""Biden"" redirect here. For his first-born son, Joseph Biden III, see Beau Biden . For other uses, see Biden (disambiguation)

Joseph Robinette Biden Jr.[b] (born November 20, 1942) is an American politician who was the 46th president of the United States from 2021 to 2025. A member of the Democratic Party, he served as the 47th vice president from 2009 to 2017 under President Barack Obama, and represented Delaware in the U.S. Senate from 1973 to 2009.

Born in Scranton, Pennsylvania, Biden moved with his family to Delaware in 1953. He graduated from the University of Delaware in 1965 and the Syracuse University College of Law in 1968. He was elected to the New Castle County Council in 1970 and the U.S. Senate in 1972, becoming one of the youngest Senators in U.S. history. As a senator, Biden served as chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee and Foreign Relations Committee. He drafted and led passage of the 1994 Crime Bill and the Violence Against Women Act. He also oversaw six U.S. Supreme Court confirmation hearings, including contentious hearings for Robert Bork and Clarence Thomas. He opposed the Gulf War in 1991 but supported NATO intervention during the Bosnian War. He voted in favor of the Iraq War Resolution in 2002. He was the fourth most senior senator at the time of his resignation, and remains one of the longest-serving Senators in history.

Biden ran unsuccessfully for the 1988 and 2008 Democratic presidential nominations. Barack Obama selected Biden as his running mate in 2008 and they won the 2008 and 2012 presidential elections. Biden was the first Roman Catholic vice president and became a close counselor to Obama. Biden won the Democratic nomination in the 2020 presidential election and chose Kamala Harris as his running mate. They beat Republican incumbents Donald Trump and Mike Pence, making Biden the first president to serve with a woman vice president, Black American vice president, and Asian American vice president. Biden was the second Catholic president after John F. Kennedy.

As president, Biden signed the American Rescue Plan Act in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent recession. Biden signed bipartisan bills on infrastructure and manufacturing as well as the Inflation Reduction Act. He appointed Ketanji Brown Jackson to the Supreme Court. In his foreign policy, Biden reentered the Paris Agreement and oversaw the complete withdrawal of U.S. troops that ended the war in Afghanistan, leading to the the Taliban retaking control from the collapsed Afghan government. He responded to the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine by imposing sanctions on Russia and authorizing civilian and military aid to Ukraine. During the Gaza war, Biden condemned the actions of Hamas as terrorism, strongly supported Israel's military efforts, and sent limited humanitarian aid to the Gaza Strip. A ceasefire proposal was adopted shortly before he left office.

Concerns about Biden's age and health persisted throughout his term. Gallup, Inc. found that Biden had an average approval rating of 42.2% throughout his presidency; he began his presidency with majority support, but saw his approval ratings decline throughout his presidency, in part due to public frustration over supply chain shortages and inflation, which peaked at 9.1% in June 2022 but dropped to 2.9% by the end of his presidency. He initially ran for reelection and, after the Democratic primaries, became the party's presumptive nominee in the 2024 presidential election. After his performance in the first presidential debate, renewed scrutiny from across the political spectrum about his cognitive ability led him to withdraw his candidacy. He was replaced as the nominee by Vice President Harris, who lost to Trump in the general election. During his term, historians and political scientists ranked Biden in the second quartile of U.S. presidents, diverging from public assessments of his tenure.

Early life (1942–1965)

Joseph Robinette Biden Jr. was born on November 20, 1942,[1] at St. Mary's Hospital in Scranton, Pennsylvania, to Catherine Eugenia ""Jean"" Biden (née Finnegan) and Joseph Robinette Biden Sr.[3][4] He was the oldest child in a Catholic family of mostly Irish descent. He has a sister, Valerie, and two brothers, Francis and James.

Biden's father had been wealthy, and the family purchased a home in the affluent Long Island suburb of Garden City in 1946,[6] but he suffered business setbacks around the time Biden was seven years old,[7][8] and for several years the family lived with Biden's maternal grandparents in Scranton.[10] Scranton fell into economic decline during the 1950s, and Biden's father could not find steady work.[11] Beginning in 1953 when Biden was ten,[12] the family lived in an apartment in Claymont, Delaware, before moving to a house in nearby Mayfield, Delaware.[13][14][8][10] Biden Sr. later became a successful used-car salesman, maintaining the family in a middle-class lifestyle.[10][11][15]

At Archmere Academy in Claymont, Biden played baseball and was a standout halfback and wide receiver on the high school football team.[10][17] Though a poor student, he was class president in his junior and senior years. He graduated in 1961. At the University of Delaware in Newark, Biden briefly played freshman football,[20][21] and, as an unexceptional student,[22] received a Bachelor of Arts degree with a double major in history and political science in 1965.[23] Biden had a stutter and has mitigated it since his early twenties.[25]

Marriages, law school, and early career (1966–1973)

Biden married Neilia Hunter, a student at Syracuse University, on August 27, 1966,[23][26] after overcoming her parents' disinclination for her to wed a Catholic. Their wedding was held in a Catholic church in Skaneateles, New York.[27] They had three children: Joseph R. ""Beau"" Biden III, Robert Hunter Biden, and Naomi Christina ""Amy"" Biden.[23]

Biden earned a Juris Doctor from Syracuse University College of Law in 1968. In his first year of law school, he failed a course because he plagiarized a law review article, but the failing grade was later stricken. His grades were relatively poor, and he graduated 76th in a class of 85.[22] He was admitted to the Delaware bar in 1969.[1]

Biden clerked at a Wilmington law firm headed by prominent local Republican William Prickett in 1968 and, he later said, ""thought of myself as a Republican"".[28][29] He disliked incumbent Democratic Delaware governor Charles L. Terry's conservative racial politics and supported a more liberal Republican, Russell W. Peterson, who defeated Terry in 1968.[28] Local Republicans attempted to recruit Biden, but he registered as an Independent because of his distaste for Republican presidential candidate Richard Nixon.[28]

Biden in the Syracuse 1968 yearbook

In 1969, Biden practiced law, first as a public defender and then at a law firm headed by a locally active Democrat,[30][28] who named him to the Democratic Forum, a group trying to reform and revitalize the state party; Biden subsequently reregistered as a Democrat.[28] He and another attorney also formed a law firm.[30] Corporate law did not appeal to him, and criminal law did not pay well.[10] He supplemented his income by managing properties.[32]

Biden ran for the fourth district seat on the New Castle County Council in 1970 on a liberal platform that included support for public housing in the suburbs.[34] Biden won the general election, defeating Republican Lawrence T. Messick, and took office on January 5, 1971.[35][36] He served until January 1, 1973.[37] During his time on the county council, Biden opposed large highway projects, which he argued might disrupt Wilmington neighborhoods.

Biden had not openly supported or opposed the Vietnam War until he ran for Senate and opposed Richard Nixon's conduct of the war. While studying at the University of Delaware and Syracuse University, Biden obtained five student draft deferments. Based on a physical examination, he was given a conditional medical deferment in 1968; in 2008, a spokesperson for Biden said his having had ""asthma as a teenager"" was the reason.[40]

1972 U.S. Senate campaign in Delaware

Neilia Hunter, Joe, Hunter, Naomi Christina and Beau Biden, c. 1972

Biden defeated Republican incumbent J. Caleb Boggs to become the junior U.S. senator from Delaware in 1972. He was the only Democrat willing to challenge Boggs and, with minimal campaign funds, he was thought to have no chance of winning.[30][10] Family members managed and staffed the campaign, which relied on meeting voters face-to-face and hand-distributing position papers,[41] an approach made feasible by Delaware's small size.[32] He received help from the AFL-CIO and Democratic pollster Patrick Caddell.[30] His platform focused on the environment, withdrawal from Vietnam, civil rights, mass transit, equitable taxation, health care and public dissatisfaction with ""politics as usual"".[30][41] A few months before the election, Biden trailed Boggs by almost thirty percentage points,[30] but his energy, attractive young family, and ability to connect with voters' emotions worked to his advantage,[15] and he won with 50.5% of the vote.[41]

Death of wife and daughter

A few weeks after Biden was elected senator, his wife Neilia and one-year-old daughter Naomi were killed in an automobile accident in Hockessin, Delaware, on December 18, 1972.[23][42] Their sons Beau (aged 3) and Hunter (aged 2) were in the car and were taken to hospital with non-life-threatening injuries. Biden considered resigning to care for them,[15] but Senate Majority Leader Mike Mansfield persuaded him not to.[44] Biden contemplated suicide and was filled with anger and religious doubt.[45][46] He wrote that he ""felt God had played a horrible trick"" on him[47] and had trouble focusing on work.[48][49]

Second marriage

Biden and his second wife, Jill, met in 1975 and married in 1977

Biden met teacher Jill Tracy Jacobs in 1975 on a blind date.[50] They married at the United Nations chapel in New York on June 17, 1977,[51][52] and spent their honeymoon at Lake Balaton in the Hungarian People's Republic.[53][54] Biden credits her with the renewal of his interest in politics and life.[55]

In 1981, the couple had a daughter, Ashley Biden.[23] She is a social worker.[56] Jill helped raise her stepsons, Hunter and Beau, who were seven and eight respectively at the time of her marriage. Hunter has worked as a Washington lobbyist and investment adviser; his business dealings, personal life, and legal troubles have come under significant scrutiny during his father's presidency. In December 2024, Biden pardoned Hunter following his conviction on gun and tax charges despite repeated promises that he would not do so.[57][58][59][60] Beau became an Army judge-advocate in Iraq and later Delaware attorney general;[61] he died of brain cancer in 2015.[62][63]

Teaching

From 1991 to 2008, as an adjunct professor, Biden co-taught a seminar on constitutional law at Widener University School of Law.[64][65]

U.S. Senate (1973–2009)

Senate activities

Biden with President Jimmy Carter, 1978

Elected to the U.S. Senate in 1972, Biden was reelected in 1978, 1984, 1990, 1996, 2002, and 2008, regularly receiving about 60% of the vote.[66] Aged 30 when first elected, he was the seventh-youngest senator in U.S. history.[67] He was junior senator to William Roth until Roth was defeated in 2000.[68] As of 2024 , he was the 19th-longest-serving senator in U.S. history.[69]

During his early years in the Senate, Biden focused on consumer protection and environmental issues and called for greater government accountability.[70] In a 1974 interview, he described himself as liberal on civil rights and liberties, senior citizens' concerns and healthcare, but conservative on other issues, including abortion and military conscription.[71] Biden was the first U.S. senator to endorse Jimmy Carter for president in the 1976 Democratic primary.[72] Carter won the Democratic nomination and the 1976 election. Biden also worked on arms control.[73][74] After Congress failed to ratify the SALT II Treaty signed in 1979 by Soviet general secretary Leonid Brezhnev and President Jimmy Carter, Biden met with Soviet foreign minister Andrei Gromyko and secured changes that addressed the Senate Foreign Relations Committee's objections.[75] He received considerable attention when he excoriated Secretary of State George Shultz at a Senate hearing for the Reagan administration's support of South Africa despite its policy of apartheid.[28] In a congressional hearing in 1984, he objected to the Strategic Defense Initiative plan to construct autonomous systems of ICBM defense.[76][77]

In the mid-1970s, Biden was one of the Senate's strongest opponents of race-integration busing. His Delaware constituents strongly opposed it, and such opposition nationwide later led his party to mostly abandon school integration policies.[78] In his first Senate campaign, Biden had expressed support for busing to remedy de jure segregation, as in the South, but opposed its use to remedy de facto segregation arising from racial patterns of neighborhood residency, as in Delaware; he opposed a proposed constitutional amendment banning busing entirely. Biden supported a 1976 measure forbidding the use of federal funds for transporting students beyond the school closest to them.[78] He co-sponsored a 1977 amendment closing loopholes in that measure, which President Carter signed into law in 1978.[80]

Biden shaking hands with President Ronald Reagan, 1984

Biden became ranking minority member of the Senate Judiciary Committee in 1981. He was a Democratic floor manager for the successful passage of the Comprehensive Crime Control Act in 1984. His supporters praised him for modifying some of the law's worst provisions, and it was his most important legislative accomplishment to that time.[81] In 1994, Biden helped pass the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act, which included a ban on assault weapons,[82][83] and the Violence Against Women Act,[84] which he has called his most significant legislation.[85] The 1994 crime law was unpopular among progressives and criticized for resulting in mass incarceration;[86][87] in 2019, Biden called his role in passing the bill a ""big mistake"", saying it ""trapped an entire generation"".[88]

Biden meeting with attorney general Janet Reno, 1993

Biden voted for a 1993 provision that deemed homosexuality incompatible with military life, thereby banning gay people from serving in the armed forces.[89][90] In 1996, he voted for the Defense of Marriage Act, which prohibited the federal government from recognizing same-sex marriages, thereby barring people in such marriages from equal protection under federal law and allowing states to do the same.[91] In 2015, the act was ruled unconstitutional in Obergefell v. Hodges.[92]

Biden was critical of Independent Counsel Ken Starr during the 1990s Whitewater controversy and Lewinsky scandal investigations, saying ""it's going to be a cold day in hell"" before another independent counsel would be granted similar powers.[93] He voted to acquit during the impeachment of Bill Clinton.[94] During the 2000s, Biden sponsored bankruptcy legislation sought by credit card issuers.[15] Bill Clinton vetoed the bill in 2000, but it passed in 2005 as the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act,[15] with Biden being one of only 18 Democrats to vote for it, while leading Democrats and consumer rights organizations opposed it.[95] As a senator, Biden strongly supported increased Amtrak funding and rail security.[66][96]

Brain surgeries

In February 1988, after several episodes of severe neck pain, Biden underwent surgery to correct a leaking intracranial berry aneurysm.[97][98] While recuperating, he suffered a pulmonary embolism.[98] A second aneurysm was surgically repaired in May.[98][99] His recuperation kept him away from the Senate for seven months.[100]

Senate Judiciary Committee

Biden was a longtime member of the Senate Committee on the Judiciary. He chaired it from 1987 to 1995 and was a ranking minority member from 1981 to 1987 and again from 1995 to 1997.[101]

As chair, Biden presided over two highly contentious U.S. Supreme Court confirmation hearings.[15] When Robert Bork was nominated in 1988, Biden reversed his approval‍—‌given in an interview the previous year‍—‌of a hypothetical Bork nomination. Conservatives were angered, but at the hearings' close Biden was praised for his fairness, humor, and courage.[103] Rejecting the arguments of some Bork opponents,[15] Biden framed his objections to Bork in terms of the conflict between Bork's strong originalism and the view that the U.S. Constitution provides rights to liberty and privacy beyond those explicitly enumerated in its text.[103] Bork's nomination was rejected in the committee by a 5–9 vote[103] and then in the full Senate, 42–58.[104]

During Clarence Thomas's nomination hearings in 1991, Biden's questions on constitutional issues were often convoluted to the point that Thomas sometimes lost track of them, and Thomas later wrote that Biden's questions were akin to ""beanballs"".[106] After the committee hearing closed, the public learned that Anita Hill had accused Thomas of making unwelcome sexual comments when they had worked together.[107][108] Biden had known of some of these charges, but initially shared them only with the committee because Hill was then unwilling to testify.[15] The committee hearing was reopened and Hill testified, but Biden did not permit testimony from other witnesses, such as a woman who had made similar charges and experts on harassment.[109] The full Senate confirmed Thomas by a 52–48 vote, with Biden opposed.[15] Liberal legal advocates and women's groups felt strongly that Biden had mishandled the hearings and not done enough to support Hill.[109] In 2019, he told Hill he regretted his treatment of her, but Hill said afterward she remained unsatisfied.[110]

Senate Foreign Relations Committee

Senator Biden accompanies President Clinton and other officials to Bosnia and Herzegovina, December 1997.

Biden was a longtime member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. He became its ranking minority member in 1997 and chaired it from June 2001 to 2003 and 2007 to 2009.[111] His positions were generally liberal internationalist.[73][112] He collaborated effectively with Republicans and sometimes went against elements of his own party.[111][112] During this time he met with at least 150 leaders from 60 countries and international organizations, becoming a well-known Democratic voice on foreign policy.[113]

Biden voted against authorization for the Gulf War in 1991.[112] He became interested in the Yugoslav Wars after hearing about Serbian abuses during the Croatian War of Independence in 1991.[73] Once the Bosnian War broke out, Biden was among the first to call for the ""lift and strike"" policy.[73][111] The George H. W. Bush administration and Clinton administration were both reluctant to implement the policy, fearing Balkan entanglement.[73][112] In April 1993, Biden had a tense three-hour meeting with Serbian leader Slobodan Milošević.[114] Biden worked on several versions of legislative language urging the U.S. toward greater involvement.[114] He has called his role in affecting Balkan policy in the mid-1990s his ""proudest moment in public life"" related to foreign policy.[112] In 1999, during the Kosovo War, Biden supported the 1999 NATO bombing of FR Yugoslavia.[73] He and Senator John McCain co-sponsored the McCain-Biden Kosovo Resolution, which called on Clinton to use all necessary force, including ground troops, to confront Milošević over Yugoslav actions toward Kosovo Albanians.[112][115]

Wars in Afghanistan and Iraq

Biden addresses the press after meeting with Prime Minister Ayad Allawi in Baghdad in 2004.

Biden was a strong supporter of the War in Afghanistan, saying, ""Whatever it takes, we should do it.""[116] As head of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, he said in 2002 that Iraqi president Saddam Hussein was a threat to national security and there was no other option than to ""eliminate"" that threat.[117] In October 2002, he voted in favor of the Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Iraq, approving the U.S. invasion of Iraq.[112] As chair of the committee, he assembled witnesses to testify in favor of the authorization. They gave testimony grossly misrepresenting the intent, history, and status of Saddam and his government, and touted Iraq's fictional possession of weapons of mass destruction.[118] Biden eventually became a critic of the war and called his role a ""mistake"", but did not push for withdrawal.[112][114] He supported the appropriations for the occupation, but argued that the war should be internationalized, that more soldiers were needed, and that the Bush administration should ""level with the American people"" about its cost and length.[111][115]

By late 2006, Biden's stance had shifted considerably. He opposed the troop surge of 2007,[112][114] saying General David Petraeus was ""dead, flat wrong"" in believing the surge could work.[119] Biden instead advocated dividing Iraq into a loose federation of three ethnic states.[120] In September 2007, a non-binding resolution endorsing the plan passed the Senate,[122] but the idea failed to gain traction.[119]

1988 and 2008 presidential campaigns

1988 campaign

Biden speaks at a campaign event, 1987

Biden declared his candidacy for the 1988 Democratic presidential nomination on June 9, 1987.[123] He was considered a strong candidate because of his moderate image, his speaking ability, his high profile as chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee at the upcoming Robert Bork Supreme Court nomination hearings, and his appeal to Baby Boomers.[28][124] He raised more in the first quarter of 1987 than any other candidate.[124]

By August, Biden's campaign messaging had become confused due to staff rivalries, and in September, he was accused of plagiarizing a speech by British Labour Party leader Neil Kinnock.[127] Biden had credited Kinnock on previous occasions,[128][129] but did not on two occasions in August.[130]: 230–232 [129] Earlier that year, Biden had also used passages from a speech by Robert F. Kennedy (for which his aides took blame) and John F. Kennedy's inaugural address; two years earlier he had used a 1976 passage by Hubert Humphrey.[131] Biden responded that politicians often borrow from one another without giving credit, and that one of his rivals for the nomination, Jesse Jackson, had called him to point out that he (Jackson) had used the same material by Humphrey that Biden had used.[15][22] A few days later, it was publicized that, while in law school, Biden had taken text from a Fordham Law Review article with inadequate citations.[22] At Biden's request the Delaware Supreme Court's Board of Professional Responsibility reviewed the incident and concluded that he had violated no rules.[132]

Biden has made several false or exaggerated claims about his early life: that he had earned three degrees in college, that he attended law school on a full scholarship, that he had graduated in the top half of his class,[133][134] and that he had marched in the civil rights movement.[135] The limited amount of other news about the presidential race amplified these disclosures,[136] and on September 23, 1987, Biden withdrew his candidacy.[137]

2008 campaign

Biden campaigns at a house party in Creston, Iowa, July 2007.

After exploring running in several previous cycles, in January 2007, Biden declared his candidacy in the 2008 elections.[66][138][139] Biden focused on the Iraq War, his record as chairman of major Senate committees, and his foreign-policy experience.[140] Biden was noted for his one-liners during the campaign; in one debate he said of Republican candidate Rudy Giuliani, ""There's only three things he mentions in a sentence: a noun, and a verb and 9/11.""[141]

Biden had difficulty raising funds, struggled to draw people to his rallies, and failed to gain traction against the high-profile candidacies of Obama and Hillary Clinton.[142] He never rose above single digits in national polls of the Democratic candidates. In the first contest on January 3, 2008, Biden placed fifth in the Iowa caucuses, garnering slightly less than one percent of the state delegates.[143] He withdrew from the race that evening.[144]

Despite its lack of success, Biden's 2008 campaign raised his stature in the political world.[145]: 336 In particular, it changed the relationship between Biden and Obama. Although they had served together on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, they had not been close: Biden resented Obama's quick rise to political stardom,[119] while Obama viewed Biden as garrulous and patronizing.[145]: 28, 337–338 Having gotten to know each other during 2007, Obama appreciated Biden's campaign style and appeal to working-class voters, and Biden said he became convinced Obama was ""the real deal"".[145]: 28, 337–338

2008 and 2012 vice presidential campaigns

2008 campaign

Biden speaks at the August 23, 2008, vice presidential announcement at the Old State Capitol in Springfield, Illinois.

In August 2008, Obama and Biden met in secret to discuss the possibility of a place for Biden in the Obama administration,[147] and developed a strong personal rapport. On August 22, 2008, Obama announced that Biden would be his running mate.[148] The New York Times reported that the choice reflected a desire for someone with foreign policy and national security experience.[149] Others pointed out Biden's appeal to middle-class and blue-collar voters.[150] Biden was officially nominated for vice president on August 27 at the 2008 Democratic National Convention in Denver.[152]

Biden's vice-presidential campaigning gained little media attention, as the press devoted far more coverage to the Republican nominee, Alaska governor Sarah Palin.[153][154] Under instructions from the campaign, Biden kept his speeches succinct and tried to avoid offhand remarks.[155][156] Privately, Biden's remarks frustrated Obama. ""How many times is Biden gonna say something stupid?"", he asked.[145]: 411–414, 419 Obama campaign staffers called Biden's blunders ""Joe bombs"" and kept Biden uninformed about strategy discussions, which irked Biden.[157] Relations between the two campaigns became strained for a month, until Biden apologized to Obama and the two built a stronger partnership.[145]: 411–414

As the 2007–2008 financial crisis reached a peak in September 2008, and the proposed Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 became a major factor in the campaign, Biden voted for the $700 billion Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008, which passed in the Senate.[158] On October 2, he participated in the vice-presidential debate with Palin at Washington University in St. Louis. Post-debate polls found that while Palin exceeded many voters' expectations, Biden had still won the debate overall. On November 4, Obama and Biden were elected.[160][161][162]

As Biden was running for vice president, he was also running for reelection to the Senate,[163] as permitted by Delaware law.[66] Having been reelected to the Senate as well as the vice presidency,[164] Biden made a point of not resigning from the Senate before he was sworn in for his seventh term in January 2009.[165] He resigned from the Senate on January 15.[166][167]

2012 campaign

In October 2010, Biden said Obama had asked him to remain as his running mate for the 2012 presidential election,[168] but with Obama's popularity on the decline, White House Chief of Staff William M. Daley conducted some secret polling and focus group research in late 2011 on the idea of replacing Biden with Hillary Clinton.[169] The notion was dropped when the results showed no appreciable improvement,[169] and White House officials later said Obama himself never entertained the idea.[170]

Biden's May 2012 statement that he was ""absolutely comfortable"" with same-sex marriage gained considerable public attention in comparison to Obama's position, which had been described as ""evolving"".[171] Biden made his statement without administration consent, and Obama and his aides were irked, since Obama had planned to shift position in the build-up to the party convention.[157][172][173] Gay rights advocates seized upon Biden's statement,[172] and within days, Obama announced that he too supported same-sex marriage, an action in part forced by Biden's remarks.[174]

Biden had a heavy schedule of appearances in swing states as the reelection campaign began in earnest in spring 2012.[175][176] An August 2012 remark before a mixed-race audience that Republican proposals to relax Wall Street regulations would ""put y'all back in chains"" again drew attention to Biden's propensity for colorful remarks.[175][177][178]

Obama watching Biden debate Paul Ryan in the vice-presidential debate on Air Force One

Following the first presidential debate of the general election, in which President Obama's performance was considered surprisingly lackluster,[179] his lead over Romney collapsed,[180] putting pressure on Biden to stop the bleeding with a strong showing against the Republican vice-presidential nominee, Paul Ryan.[181][182] Some political analysts considered Biden's performance in the October 11 vice-presidential debate one of the best of his career[183][184] and a key factor in Obama's rebound in the polls and eventual victory.[185][186] The debate also became memorable for the popularization of Biden's use of the phrase ""a bunch of malarkey"" in response to an attack by Ryan on the administration's response to the September 11, 2012, attacks on the U.S. embassy in Benghazi.[187][188] Biden reused the phrase during his 2020 presidential campaign.[189] On November 6, Obama and Biden were reelected.[190]

Vice presidency (2009–2017)

First term (2009–2013)

Biden being sworn in as vice president by Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens on January 20, 2009

Biden said he intended to eliminate some explicit roles assumed by George W. Bush's vice president, Dick Cheney, and did not intend to emulate any previous vice presidency.[191] He was sworn in on January 20, 2009.[192] He was the first vice president from Delaware[193] and the first Roman Catholic vice president.[194][195]

Biden visited Kosovo in May and affirmed the U.S. position that its ""independence is irreversible"".[196] Biden lost an internal debate to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton about sending 21,000 new troops to Afghanistan,[197][198] but his skepticism was valued,[199] and in 2009, Biden's views gained more influence as Obama reconsidered his Afghanistan strategy.[200] Biden visited Iraq about every two months,[119] becoming the administration's point man in delivering messages to Iraqi leadership about expected progress there.[199] More generally, overseeing Iraq policy became Biden's responsibility.[201] By 2012, Biden had made eight trips there, but his oversight of U.S. policy in Iraq receded with the exit of U.S. troops in 2011.[176][202]

Biden oversaw infrastructure spending from the Obama stimulus package intended to help counteract the ongoing recession.[203] When he completed that role in February 2011, he said the number of fraud incidents with stimulus monies had been less than one percent.[204]

Biden's off-message response to a question in April 2009, during the beginning of the swine flu outbreak, led to a swift retraction by the White House.[205] The remark revived Biden's reputation for gaffes.[206][200][207] Confronted with rising unemployment through July 2009, Biden acknowledged that the administration had ""misread how bad the economy was"", but maintained confidence the stimulus package would create many more jobs once the pace of expenditures picked up.[208] A hot mic picked up Biden telling Obama that his signing the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act was ""a big fucking deal"" on March 23, 2010. Despite their different personalities, Obama and Biden formed a friendship, partly based around Obama's daughter Sasha and Biden's granddaughter Maisy, who attended Sidwell Friends School together.[157]

President Obama congratulates Biden for his role in shaping the debt ceiling deal which led to the Budget Control Act of 2011.

Members of the Obama administration said Biden's role in the White House was to be a contrarian and force others to defend their positions.[209] Rahm Emanuel, White House chief of staff, said that Biden helped counter groupthink.[210] The Bidens maintained a relaxed atmosphere at their official residence in Washington, often entertaining their grandchildren, and regularly returned to their home in Delaware.[211]

Biden campaigned heavily for Democrats in the 2010 midterm elections, maintaining an attitude of optimism in the face of predictions of large-scale losses for the party.[168] Following big Republican gains in the elections and the departure of Emanuel, Biden's past relationships with Republicans in Congress became more important.[212][213] He led the successful administration effort to gain Senate approval for the New START treaty.[212][213] In December 2010, Biden's advocacy for a middle ground, followed by his negotiations with Senate minority leader Mitch McConnell, were instrumental in producing the administration's compromise tax package that included a temporary extension of the Bush tax cuts.[213][214] The package passed as the Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010.

Biden, Obama and the national security team gathered in the White House Situation Room to monitor the progress of the May 2011 mission to kill Osama bin Laden.

Obama delegated Biden to lead negotiations with Congress in March 2011 to resolve federal spending levels and avoid a government shutdown.[215] The U.S. debt ceiling crisis developed over the next few months, but Biden's relationship with McConnell again proved key in bringing about a deal to resolve it, in the form of the Budget Control Act of 2011.[216][217][218] Some reports suggest that Biden opposed proceeding with the May 2011 U.S. mission to kill Osama bin Laden,[176][219] lest failure adversely affect Obama's reelection prospects.[220][221]

Obama named Biden to head the Gun Violence Task Force, created to address the causes of school shootings and consider possible gun control measures in the aftermath of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, in December 2012.[222] Later that month, during the final days before the United States fell off the ""fiscal cliff"", Biden's relationship with McConnell again proved important as the two negotiated a deal that led to the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 being passed at the start of 2013.[223][224]

Second term (2013–2017)

Biden was inaugurated to a second term on January 20, 2013, at a small ceremony at Number One Observatory Circle, his official residence, with Justice Sonia Sotomayor presiding (a public ceremony took place on January 21).[225] He played little part in discussions that led to the October 2013 passage of the Continuing Appropriations Act, 2014, which resolved the federal government shutdown of 2013 and the debt-ceiling crisis of 2013. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and other Democratic leaders cut him out of direct talks with Congress, feeling Biden had given too much away during previous negotiations.[226][227][228]

Biden in Morocco, November 2014

Biden's Violence Against Women Act was reauthorized again in 2013. The act led to related developments, such as the White House Council on Women and Girls, begun in the first term, as well as the White House Task Force to Protect Students from Sexual Assault, begun in January 2014 with Biden and Valerie Jarrett as co-chairs.[229][230] He talked about sexual violence while introducing Lady Gaga at the 88th Academy Awards in 2016, receiving a standing ovation from the audience.[231]

Biden with Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Jerusalem, March 9, 2016

Biden favored arming Syria's rebel fighters.[232] As the ISIL insurgency in Iraq intensified in 2014, renewed attention was paid to the Biden-Gelb Iraqi federalization plan of 2006, with some observers suggesting Biden had been right all along.[233][234] He had close relationships with several Latin American leaders and visited the region 16 times during his vice presidency, the most of any president or vice president.[235] In August 2016, Biden visited Serbia, where he met with the Serbian Prime Minister Aleksandar Vučić and expressed condolences for civilian victims of the bombing campaign during the Kosovo War.[236] Biden never cast a tie-breaking vote in the Senate, making him the longest-serving vice president with this distinction.[237]

Role in the 2016 presidential campaign

During his second term, Biden was often said to be preparing for a bid for the 2016 Democratic presidential nomination.[238] With his family, friends, and donors encouraging him in mid-2015 to enter the race, and with Hillary Clinton's favorability ratings in decline at that time, Biden was reported to be seriously considering the prospect and a ""Draft Biden 2016"" PAC was established.[238][239][240]

By late 2015, Biden was still uncertain about running. He felt his son Beau's recent death had largely drained his emotional energy, and said, ""nobody has a right ... to seek that office unless they're willing to give it 110% of who they are.""[241] On October 21, Biden announced his decision not to run for president in 2016.[242][243][244]

Post-vice presidency (2017–2021)

Biden with Barack Obama and Donald Trump, at the latter's inauguration on January 20, 2017

After leaving the vice presidency, Biden became an honorary professor at the University of Pennsylvania, developing the Penn Biden Center for Diplomacy and Global Engagement. Biden remained in that position into 2019.[245][246]

In 2017, Biden wrote a memoir, Promise Me, Dad, and went on a book tour.[247] By 2019, he and his wife reported that they had earned over $15 million since the end of his vice presidency from speaking engagements and book sales.[248]

Biden remained in the public eye, endorsing candidates while continuing to comment on politics, climate change, and the presidency of Donald Trump.[249][250][251] He also continued to speak out in favor of LGBT rights, continuing advocacy on an issue he had become more closely associated with during his vice presidency.[252][253] In 2018, he gave a eulogy for Senator John McCain.[254] Biden continued to support cancer research.[255]

2020 presidential campaign

Speculation and announcement

Biden at his presidential kickoff rally in Philadelphia, May 2019

Between 2016 and 2019, media outlets often mentioned Biden as a likely candidate for president in 2020.[256] When asked if he would run, he gave varied and ambivalent answers, saying ""never say never"".[257] A political action committee known as Time for Biden was formed in January 2018.[258] Biden launched his campaign on April 25, 2019,[259] saying he was worried by the Trump administration and felt a ""sense of duty"".[260]

Campaign

As the 2020 campaign season heated up, public polling showed Biden as one of the best-performing Democratic candidates head-to-head against Trump.[261][262][263] With Democrats keenly focused on ""electability"" for defeating Trump,[264] this boosted his popularity among Democratic voters.[265] It also made Biden a frequent target of Trump.[266][267] In September 2019, it was reported that Trump had pressured Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy to investigate alleged wrongdoing by Biden and his son Hunter Biden.[268] No evidence was produced of any wrongdoing by the Bidens.[269][270][271] Trump was perceived by many as attempting to hurt Biden's chances of winning the presidency,[272] resulting in a political scandal[273] and Trump's impeachment.[274]

In March 2019 and April 2019, eight women accused Biden of inappropriate physical contact, such as embracing, touching or kissing.[275] Biden had previously called himself a ""tactile politician"" and admitted this behavior had caused trouble for him.[276] Journalist Mark Bowden described Biden's lifelong habit of talking close, writing that he ""doesn't just meet you, he engulfs you... scooting closer"" and leaning forward to talk.[277] In April 2019, Biden pledged to be more ""respectful of people's personal space"".[278]

Biden at a rally on the eve of the Iowa caucuses, February 2020

Throughout 2019, Biden stayed generally ahead of other Democrats in national polls.[279][280] Despite this, he finished fourth in the Iowa caucuses and fifth in the New Hampshire primary.[281][282] He performed better in the Nevada caucuses, reaching the 15% required for delegates, but still finished 21.6 percentage points behind Bernie Sanders.[283] Making strong appeals to Black voters on the campaign trail and in the South Carolina debate, Biden won the South Carolina primary by more than 28 points.[284] After the withdrawals and subsequent endorsements of candidates Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar, he made large gains in the Super Tuesday primaries. Biden won 18 of the next 26 contests, putting him in the lead.[285] Elizabeth Warren and Mike Bloomberg soon dropped out, and Biden expanded his lead with victories over Sanders in four states on March 10.[286]

In late March 2020, Tara Reade, one of the eight women who in 2019 had accused Biden of inappropriate physical contact, accused Biden of having sexually assaulted her in 1993.[287] There were inconsistencies between Reade's 2019 and 2020 allegations.[287][288] Biden and his campaign denied the sexual assault allegation.[289][290]

When Sanders suspended his campaign on April 8, 2020, Biden became the Democratic Party's presumptive nominee.[291] On April 13, Sanders endorsed Biden.[292] Barack Obama endorsed Biden the next day.[293] On August 11, Biden announced U.S. senator Kamala Harris as his running mate, making her the first African American and first South Asian American vice-presidential nominee on a major-party ticket.[294] On August 18, 2020, at the 2020 Democratic National Convention, Biden officially became the Democratic Party nominee for president in the 2020 election.[295][296]

Presidential transition

2020 electoral vote results. Biden won 306–232

Biden was elected the 46th president in November 2020, defeating the incumbent, Donald Trump. Trump refused to concede, insisting the election had been ""stolen"" through ""voter fraud"", challenging the results in court and promoting numerous conspiracy theories about the voting and vote-counting processes, in an attempt to overturn the election results.[297] Biden's transition was delayed by several weeks as the White House ordered federal agencies not to cooperate.[298] On November 23, General Services Administrator Emily W. Murphy formally recognized Biden as the apparent winner of the 2020 election and authorized the start of a transition process to the Biden administration.[299]

On January 6, 2021, during Congress's electoral vote count, Trump told supporters gathered in front of the White House to march to the Capitol and refused to concede.[300] Soon after, some of his supporters attacked the Capitol. During the attack, Biden addressed the nation, calling the events ""an unprecedented assault unlike anything we've seen in modern times"".[301][302] After the Capitol was cleared, Congress officially certified the election results with Vice President Mike Pence, in his capacity as President of the Senate, declaring Biden and Harris the winners.[303]

Presidency (2021–2025)

Inauguration

Biden was inaugurated as the 46th president of the United States on January 20, 2021.[304][305] At 78, he was the oldest person to have assumed the office.[304][306] He is the second Catholic president (after John F. Kennedy)[307][308] and the first president whose home state is Delaware.[309] He is also the first man since George H. W. Bush to have been both vice president and president, and the second non-incumbent vice president (after Richard Nixon in 1968) to be elected president.[310] He is also the first and only president to date from the Silent Generation.[311][312]

Biden's inauguration was ""a muted affair unlike any previous inauguration"" due to COVID-19 precautions as well as massively increased security measures because of the January 6 United States Capitol attack. Trump did not attend, becoming the first outgoing president since 1869 to not attend his successor's inauguration.[313]

First 100 days

In his first two days as president, Biden signed 17 executive orders. By his third day, orders had included rejoining the Paris Climate Agreement, ending the state of national emergency at the border with Mexico, directing the government to rejoin the World Health Organization, face mask requirements on federal property, measures to combat hunger in the United States,[314][315][316][317] and revoking permits for the construction of the Keystone XL pipeline.[318][319][320]

Biden with his Cabinet, July 2021

On March 11, Biden signed into law the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021, a $1.9 trillion economic stimulus and relief package that he had proposed to support the United States' recovery from the economic and health effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.[321] The package included direct payments to most Americans, an extension of increased unemployment benefits, funds for vaccine distribution and school reopenings, and expansions of health insurance subsidies and the child tax credit. Biden's initial proposal included an increase of the federal minimum wage to $15 per hour, but after the Senate parliamentarian determined that including the increase in a budget reconciliation bill would violate Senate rules, Democrats removed it.[322][323][324]

Also in March, amid a rise in migrants entering the U.S. from Mexico, Biden said migrant adults were ""being sent back"", in reference to the continuation of the Trump administration's Title 42 policy for quick deportations.[325] He earlier announced that his administration would not deport unaccompanied migrant children; the rise in arrivals of such children exceeded the capacity of facilities meant to shelter them, leading the Biden administration in March to direct the Federal Emergency Management Agency to help.[326]

On April 14, Biden announced that the United States would delay the withdrawal of all troops from the war in Afghanistan until September 11, signaling an end to the country's direct military involvement in Afghanistan after nearly 20 years.[327] In February 2020, the Trump administration had made a deal with the Taliban to completely withdraw U.S. forces by May 1, 2021.[328] Biden's decision met with a range of reactions, from support and relief to trepidation at the possible collapse of the Afghan government without American support.[329] On April 22–23, Biden held an international climate summit at which he announced that the U.S. would cut its greenhouse gas emissions by 50%–52% by 2030 compared to 2005 levels.[330][331] On April 28, the eve of his 100th day in office, Biden delivered his first address to a joint session of Congress.[332]

Domestic policy

On June 17, Biden signed the Juneteenth National Independence Day Act, which officially declared Juneteenth a federal holiday.[333] In July 2021, amid a slowing of the COVID-19 vaccination rate in the country and the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant, Biden said that it was ""gigantically important"" for Americans to be vaccinated.[334]

In 2022, Biden endorsed a change to the Senate filibuster to allow for the passing of the Freedom to Vote Act and John Lewis Voting Rights Act.[335] The rules change failed when two Democratic senators joined Senate Republicans in opposing it.[336] In April 2022, Biden signed into law the bipartisan Postal Service Reform Act of 2022 to revamp the finances and operations of the United States Postal Service agency.[337] Biden supported the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act aimed to address gun reform issues following the Robb Elementary School shooting in Uvalde, Texas;[338] he signed the bill on June 25, 2022.[339]

The Honoring our PACT Act of 2022 was introduced in 2021 and signed into law by Biden on August 10, 2022.[340] The act intends to significantly improve healthcare access and funding for veterans who were exposed to toxic substances, including burn pits, during military service.[341]

In 2022, Biden signed the Respect for Marriage Act, which repealed the Defense of Marriage Act and requires the federal government to recognize the validity of same-sex and interracial marriages.[342]

In June 2024, Biden issued an executive action offering amnesty to unauthorized immigrants married to American citizens. The program included a pathway to U.S. residency and citizenship and was expected to initially affect about 500,000 people. It was later struck down due to a lack of legislation empowering the president to enact the program.[343][344]

In January 2025, Biden declared the lapsed Equal Rights Amendment ratified as the ""28th Amendment"" to the constitution. The declaration has no formal effect[345][346] and the National Archives has said it does not intend to certify the amendment as part of the constitution due to ""established legal, judicial, and procedural decisions"".[347]

Economy

Inflation rate, United States and eurozone, January 2018 through November 2024

Biden entered office nine months into a recovery from the COVID-19 recession and his first year in office was characterized by robust growth in real GDP, employment, wages, and stock market returns, amid significantly elevated inflation. Real GDP grew 5.9%, the fastest rate in 37 years.[348][349] Amid record job creation, the unemployment rate fell at the fastest pace on record during the year.[350][351][352] By the end of 2021, inflation rates measured by the consumer price index (CPI) reached a nearly 40-year high of 7.1%, which was partially offset by the highest nominal wage and salary growth in at least 20 years. The inflation rate peaked at 9% in June 2022.[353][354][355][356][357] The inflation rate reached 2.9% and core inflation rate reached 3.2% on an annual basis in December 2024, the last full month of Biden's term. Between December 2020 and December 2024, CPI rose 21.3% overall, with an annualized inflation rate of 5.3% throughout Biden's term in office. The inflation rate remained above the Federal Reserve's 2% target every month since March 2021, resulting in elevated interest rates to combat inflation. Average wages increased 19% throughout Biden's presidency, falling behind inflation. The unemployment rate declined by over 2% and real GDP grew 11% during Biden's term. Total household net worth increased by 28%, largely driven by stocks and real estate. The national debt grew to $36.2 trillion, with a debt to GDP ratio of 123% and a deficit to GDP ratio of 6% in FY 2024.[358][353][359]

Percentage of uninsured Americans under age 65 from 2010 to 2022. The number and percentage of those uninsured under Biden fell to their lowest levels since 1997. [ 360 ]

Amid a surge in inflation and high gas prices, Biden's approval ratings declined, with his disapproval rating surpassing his approval rating in early 2022.[361][362][363] After 5.9% growth in 2021, real GDP growth cooled in 2022 to 2.1%, after slightly negative growth in the first half spurred recession concerns. Job creation and consumer spending remained strong through the year, as the unemployment rate fell to match a 53-year low of 3.5% in December. Inflation peaked at 9.1% in June before easing to 3.2% by October 2023. Stocks had had their worst year since 2008[364][365][366] before recovering. Widespread predictions of an imminent recession did not materialize in 2022 or 2023, and by late 2023 indicators showed sharply lower inflation with economic acceleration. GDP growth hit 4.9% in the third quarter of 2023 and the year ended with stocks near record highs, with robust holiday spending.[367][368][369]

Biden signed numerous major pieces of economic legislation in the 117th Congress, including the American Rescue Plan, Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, CHIPS and Science Act, and the Inflation Reduction Act.[370] He signed the CHIPS and Science Act into law on August 9, 2022.[371] It provided billions of dollars in new funding to boost domestic research on and manufacture of semiconductors, to compete economically with China.[372] In his third month in office, Biden also signed an executive order to increase the minimum wage for federal contractors to $15 per hour. The order went into effect for 390,000 workers in January 2022.[373][374] His administration rigorously enforced antitrust law.

In 2022, Biden blocked a national railroad strike planned by multiple labor unions.[375] During the United Auto Workers strike, he expressed support for the workers in negotiations.[376] Biden joined striking UAW workers' picket line in Michigan, becoming the first president to join a picket line.[377] He refused to block a port strike from the International Longshoremen's Association in October 2024.[378]

Over the course of five days in March 2023, three small- to mid-size U.S. banks failed, triggering a sharp decline in global bank stock prices and swift response by regulators to prevent potential global contagion. After Silicon Valley Bank collapsed, the first to do so, Biden expressed opposition to a bailout by taxpayers.[379] He claimed that the partial rollback of Dodd-Frank regulations contributed to the bank's failure.[380]

At the beginning of the 118th Congress, Biden and congressional Republicans engaged in a standoff after the U.S. hit its debt limit, which raised the risk that the U.S. would default on its debt.[381] Biden and House speaker Kevin McCarthy struck a deal to raise the debt limit, the Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023, which suspended the debt limit until January 2025. Biden signed it on June 3, averting a default.[382] The deal was generally seen as favorable to Biden.[383][384]

Biden extended the COVID-19 student loan pause through September 2023, with an ""on ramp"" period that extended some of the pause's protections against credit reporting, collection efforts, and late payment fees through September 30, 2024.[385] The Biden administration's attempts to implement student loan forgiveness and relief programs have faced legal challenges from a coalition of Republican-led states.[386] Biden's plans to forgive student loan debt were estimated to cost over $519 billion,[387] and some critics called them a ""disaster"".[388]

Judiciary

By the end of 2021, 40 of his nominees to the federal judiciary had been confirmed, more than any president in his first year in office since Ronald Reagan.[389] Biden has prioritized diversity in his judicial appointments more than any president in U.S. history, with most of his appointees being women and people of color.[390]

In January 2022, Supreme Court justice Stephen Breyer announced his intention to retire. During his 2020 campaign, Biden vowed to nominate the first Black woman to the Supreme Court if a vacancy occurred,[391] a promise he reiterated after Breyer announced his retirement.[392] On February 25, Biden nominated federal judge Ketanji Brown Jackson.[393] She was sworn in on June 30.[394] By the end of his presidency, Biden had appointed 235 judges, more appointments in a single term than any other president in at least 50 years. 63% of Biden's judges were women and 60% were non-white.[395][396] Biden expressed interest in judicial term limits and a binding ethics code for Supreme Court justices.[397]

Infrastructure and climate

Biden, then UK prime minister Boris Johnson and UN secretary-general António Guterres at the opening ceremony of the COP26 climate summit in Glasgow on November 1, 2021

As part of Biden's Build Back Better agenda, in late March 2021, he proposed the American Jobs Plan, a $2 trillion package addressing issues including transport infrastructure, utilities infrastructure, broadband infrastructure, housing, schools, manufacturing, research and workforce development.[398][399] After months of negotiations among Biden and lawmakers, in August 2021 the Senate passed a $1 trillion bipartisan infrastructure bill called the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act,[400][401] while the House, also in a bipartisan manner, approved that bill in early November 2021, covering infrastructure related to transport, utilities, and broadband.[402] Biden signed the bill into law in mid-November 2021.[403]

The other core part of the Build Back Better agenda was the Build Back Better Act, a $3.5 trillion social spending bill that expands the social safety net and includes major provisions on climate change.[404][405] Democrats attempted to pass it on a party-line vote through budget reconciliation, but struggled to win the support of Senator Joe Manchin, even as the price was lowered to $2.2 trillion.[406] After Manchin rejected the bill,[407] it was comprehensively reworked into the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, covering deficit reduction, climate change, healthcare, and tax reform.[408]

The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 was introduced by Manchin and Senator Chuck Schumer.[409][410] The package aimed to raise $739 billion and authorize $370 billion in spending on energy and climate change, $300 billion in deficit reduction, three years of Affordable Care Act subsidies, prescription drug reform to lower prices, and tax reform.[411] According to an analysis by the Rhodium Group, the bill will lower U.S. greenhouse gas emissions between 31 percent and 44 percent below 2005 levels by 2030.[412] On August 7, 2022, the Senate passed the bill (as amended) on a 51–50 vote, with all Democrats voting in favor, all Republicans opposed, and Vice President Kamala Harris breaking the tie. Biden signed the bill on August 16.[413][414]

Before and during the 2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP26), Biden promoted an agreement that the U.S. and the European Union cut methane emissions by a third by 2030 and tried to add dozens of other countries to the effort.[415] Biden pledged to double climate funding to developing countries by 2024.[416] Also at COP26, the U.S. and China reached a deal on greenhouse gas emission reduction. The two countries are responsible for 40 percent of global emissions.[417] In July 2023, when heat waves hit the United STates, Biden announced measures to protect the population and said the heat waves were linked to climate change.[418][419] In April 2024, he unveiled a plan to protect and restore natural water sources (3.2 million hectares of wetlands and 161,000 km of waterways).[420]

Biden protected 674 million acres of land and ocean from natural resource exploitation, more than any other president. The vast majority of the conservation came from a ban on offshore drilling in 625 million acres of ocean.[421][422]

Immigration

Yearly numbers of illegal immigrants apprehended at the U.S. southern border

Illegal border crossings at the Mexico–United States border began to surge in 2021 when Biden assumed office,[423][424][425][426] reaching an all-time monthly high in December 2023.[427][428] Throughout 2024, crossings began to significantly decline from the December record, after Biden implemented restrictions on asylum claims from migrants who cross the border between ports of entry and urged Mexico to crack down on migrants.[429][430][431] Deportations from October 2023 to September 2024 reached the highest level since 2014.[432] Biden used humanitarian parole to an unprecedented degree to mitigate illegal border crossings, allowing migrants to fly into the U.S. or schedule their entries through official entry points in the U.S.-Mexico border. Over a million migrants had been admitted to the U.S. under humanitarian parole as of January 2024.[433][434][435]

Biden visiting border patrol agents at the U.S. southern border, January 2023

In January 2024, Biden expressed support for a proposed bipartisan immigration deal led by Senators Kyrsten Sinema and James Lankford. He had previously supported the U.S. Citizenship Act of 2021, which he proposed on his first day in office.[436][437] The proposed bipartisan bill would have allowed DHS to close the border when encounters reach a seven-day average of 5,000 or exceed 8,500 in a single day.[438][439] In addition, the bill would have mandated the detention of migrants seeking asylum and undergoing asylum interviews, with those failing the process repatriated to their home countries.[440] While not addressing the status of ""Dreamers"", it would have changed immigration law to allow the children of those with H-1B visas to get work authorizations and freeze their legal ages while waiting for green cards, rather than face deportation once they turn 21, and provide additional funding for immigration judges.[441]

Former president Donald Trump announced his opposition to the legislation, calling on Congressional Republicans to oppose it; subsequently, leaders such as Speaker of the House Mike Johnson announced their opposition, halting further legislative action.[442][443] As a result of continued high immigration levels throughout his tenure, some lawmakers and pundits have criticized Biden's handling of the southern border.[444][445][446] Criticism of the bill and broader immigration policy continued to be expressed by both sides, with some liberals considering his policies too harsh while some conservatives considered them too lax.[447][448] On January 17, 2024, a Republican-led non-binding resolution denouncing the Biden-Harris administration's handling of the U.S. southern border passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 225–187, with 211 Republicans and 14 Democrats supporting it.[449] In the final year of his presidency, the Biden administration worked to extend at least 14 contracts with private prison companies to run immigrant detention centers, despite his 2020 campaign promise to end the practice.[450] In June 2024, Biden issued an executive order allowing the president to restrict the Mexico–U.S. border.[451][452]

Pardons and commutations

Biden issued more individual pardons and commutations than any other president.[453] On October 6, 2022, he pardoned all Americans convicted of ""small"" amounts of cannabis possession under federal law.[454] On December 22, 2023, he pardoned Americans for cannabis use or possession on federal lands regardless of whether they had been charged or prosecuted.[455][456] On December 12, 2024, in the largest single-day clemency act in history, Biden granted clemency to about 1,500 nonviolent felons in home confinement who had previously been released from prison.[457][458] The act generated controversy, as it included felons such as Michael Conahan, a judge involved in the kids for cash kickback scandal, and Rita Crundwell, a comptroller responsible for the single largest municipal fraud in U.S. history. The Biden administration said the offenders who received clemency ""deserve a second chance"" and were selected based on meeting certain criteria in a uniform decision.[459][460] On December 23, 2024, Biden commuted the sentences of 37 out of 40 federal death row inmates.[461] On his last day in office, Biden commuted the sentence of Leonard Peltier, convicted of murdering two FBI agents, to house arrest.[462]

Pardons of family members and political figures

Pardon dated December 1, 2024

Biden issued more pardons for members of his family than any other president.[463] On December 1, 2024, he issued a ""full and unconditional"" pardon to Hunter Biden that covered all federal offenses between 2014 and December 1, 2024. The pardon's sweeping extent was ""unprecedented"".[464] According to Reason magazine, Hunter Biden's pardon was even more far-reaching than Richard Nixon's or other ""controversial""[464] pardons:

The Hunter pardon is far more comprehensive...in that it covered not just his convictions for drug-related activities and tax fraud, but any other criminal behavior since 2014—the year that Hunter joined the board of Ukrainian energy company Burisma. It has been alleged that Hunter's job was essentially to trade on the family name and sell his access to dad. This may not have been illegal, but it does mean that the pardon is clearly designed to offer preemptive protection not just to Hunter, but to Joe Biden himself. These features make the pardon unprecedented, though perfectly in line with the president's executive powers.

Hunter had been convicted on charges related to tax and gun offenses, after which Joe made numerous promises not to pardon him. He and his staff continued to say that Hunter would not be pardoned as late as November, although internal staff discussions affirmed that the option remained on the table even as Biden said otherwise.[465][466][57] Biden and his family finalized the decision to pardon Hunter without consulting senior staff.[467] In a statement announcing the pardon, Biden said he believed his son was ""selectively, and unfairly, prosecuted"", blaming ""political pressure"" for the collapse of a plea bargain. The plea bargain actually fell apart after the presiding judge asked about its unusual construction.[60][468][469] Biden's pardon came amid incoming December sentencing dates for Hunter for his convictions and concerns about the succeeding Trump administration potentially targeting political rivals for prosecution.[467] Biden said, ""I hope Americans will understand why a father and a president would come to this decision.""[470]

On his last day in office, Biden issued pardons for more of his family members and other high-profile figures.[463] The pardons covered Biden's siblings and their spouses, including James Biden, who was interviewed as part of an impeachment probe into Biden. Others pardoned that day include former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Mark Milley, former National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases director Anthony Fauci, and members and participants in the House Select Committee on the January 6 Attack, despite many of those pardoned not having been under criminal investigation.[463][453] Biden justified the pardons by citing his concern about ""baseless and politically motivated investigations"" during Trump's second term.[471][472][473] Biden added that the pardons were preemptive and should not be seen as implying their recipients' guilt.[474][475] The pardons Biden granted to his family and other political figures had a sweeping scope similar to the one he granted Hunter, covering federal offenses the recipients committed or may have committed between 2014 and the day of the pardon.[453][476]

Biden also pardoned two other Democratic officials on his last day in office: Ernest William Cromartie, convicted of tax evasion, and Gerald G. Lundergan, convicted of a scheme to funnel money to his daughter's Senate campaign.[477][478][479]

2022 elections

On September 2, 2022, in a nationally broadcast Philadelphia speech, Biden called for a ""battle for the soul of the nation"". Off camera, he called Trump supporters ""semi-fascists"", which Republican commentators denounced.[480][481][482] A predicted Republican wave election did not materialize and the race for U.S. Congress control was much closer than expected, with Republicans securing a slim majority of 222 seats in the House of Representatives,[483][484][485][486] and the Democratic caucus keeping control of the U.S. Senate.[487][c]

It was the first midterm election since 1986 in which the party of the incumbent president achieved a net gain in governorships, and the first since 1934 in which the president's party lost no state legislative chambers.[491] Democrats credited Biden for their unexpectedly favorable performance.[492]

Foreign policy

In June 2021, Biden took his first trip abroad as president, visiting Belgium, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom. He attended a G7 summit, a NATO summit, and an EU summit, and held one-on-one talks with Russian president Vladimir Putin.[493]

In September 2021, Biden announced AUKUS, a security pact between Australia, the United Kingdom and the United States, to ensure ""peace and stability in the Indo-Pacific"".[494]

In February 2021, the Biden administration announced that the United States was ending its support for the Saudi-led bombing campaign in Yemen and revoked the designation of Yemen's Houthis as terrorists.[495][496] In early February 2022, Biden ordered the counterterrorism raid in northern Syria that resulted in the death of Abu Ibrahim al-Hashimi al-Qurashi, the second leader of the Islamic State.[497] In late July, Biden approved the drone strike that killed Ayman al-Zawahiri, the second leader of Al-Qaeda, and an integral member in the planning of the September 11 attacks.[498] The 2022 OPEC+ oil production cut caused a diplomatic spat with Saudi Arabia, threatening a longstanding alliance.[499][500]

In August 2024, Biden negotiated and oversaw the 2024 Ankara prisoner exchange, the largest prisoner exchange since the end of the Cold War. It involved the release of 26 people, including journalist Evan Gershkovich and former Marine Paul Whelan.[501] In November 2024, the Biden administration announced that it had helped broker a ceasefire agreement in the Israel–Hezbollah conflict.[502][503][504][505]

Withdrawal from Afghanistan

American forces had begun withdrawing from Afghanistan in 2020, under the provisions of a February 2020 US-Taliban agreement that set a May 1, 2021, deadline.[506] The Taliban began an offensive on May 1.[507][508] By early July, most American troops in Afghanistan had withdrawn.[328] Biden addressed the withdrawal in July, saying, ""The likelihood there's going to be the Taliban overrunning everything and owning the whole country is highly unlikely.""[328]

On August 15, the Afghan government collapsed under the Taliban offensive, and Afghan President Ashraf Ghani fled the country.[328][509] Biden reacted by ordering 6,000 American troops to assist with evacuating American personnel and Afghan allies.[510] He faced bipartisan criticism for the manner of the withdrawal,[511] with the evacuations described as chaotic and botched.[512][513][514] On August 16, Biden addressed the ""messy"" situation, taking responsibility for it, and admitting that the situation ""unfolded more quickly than we had anticipated"".[509][515] He defended his decision to withdraw, saying that Americans should not be ""dying in a war that Afghan forces are not willing to fight for themselves"".[515][516]

On August 26, a suicide bombing at the Kabul airport killed 13 U.S. service members and 169 Afghans. On August 27, an American drone strike killed two ISIS-K targets, who were ""planners and facilitators"", according to a U.S. Army general.[517] The U.S. military completed its withdrawal from Afghanistan on August 30. Biden called the extraction of over 120,000 Americans, Afghans, and other allies ""an extraordinary success"".[518] He acknowledged that up to 200 Americans who wanted to leave did not, despite his August 18 pledge to keep troops in Afghanistan until all Americans who wanted to leave had left.[519]

After the withdrawal, the U.S. continued to send aid to Afghanistan, remaining its biggest aid donor as of August 2024 and spending at least $20.7 billion post-withdrawal. U.S. funding has helped support the Taliban government and stabilize Afghanistan's economy.[520][521] On September 25, 2024, the United States House of Representatives passed a resolution condemning the Biden administration for the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan, with ten Democrats and all Republicans voting in favor.[522]

Russian invasion of Ukraine

In February 2022, the Russian Armed Forces under President Vladimir Putin launched an invasion of Ukraine. After warning for several weeks that an attack was imminent, Biden responded by imposing severe sanctions on Russia and authorizing over $8 billion in weapons shipments to Ukraine.[523][524][525] On April 29, he asked Congress for $33 billion for Ukraine,[526][527] but lawmakers later increased it to about $40 billion.[528][529][530] Biden blamed Putin for the emerging energy and food crises.[531][532][533]

In 2022, Congress approved about $113 billion in aid to Ukraine.[534] In October 2023, the Biden administration requested an additional $61.4 billion in aid for Ukraine for the year ahead,[535] but delays in the passage of further aid by the House of Representatives inhibited progress, with the additional $61 billion in aid to Ukraine added in April 2024.[536][537][538] Actually delivered aid often differed from announced levels and was also often delayed. The Government Accountability Office and Pentagon Inspector General found that the Biden administration seemed unaware of the pace of weapons deliveries.[539]

Throughout the conflict, Biden consistently refused Ukrainian requests to allow them to utilize weapons against Russian military targets inside Russia. An exception was granted in May 2024 for targets in the vicinity of Kharkiv for ""counter-fire"" purposes.[540][541][542][543] Biden also blocked access for some weapons systems altogether, typically citing fears of escalation, only to permit deliveries for some weapons later on.[544][545][546][547][548]

China affairs

The Solomon Islands-China security pact caused alarm in late 2022, as China could build military bases across the South Pacific. Biden sought to strengthen ties with Australia and New Zealand in the wake of the deal.[549][550][551] In a September 2022 interview with 60 Minutes, Biden said that U.S. forces would defend Taiwan in the event of ""an unprecedented attack"" by the Chinese,[552] which is in contrast to the long-standing U.S. policy of ""strategic ambiguity"" toward China and Taiwan.[553][554][555] The September comments came after three previous comments by Biden that the U.S. would defend Taiwan in the event of a Chinese invasion.[556] Amid increasing tension with China, Biden's administration has repeatedly walked back his statements and asserted that U.S. policy toward Taiwan has not changed.[556][557][553] In late 2022, Biden issued several executive orders and federal rules designed to slow Chinese technological growth, and maintain U.S. leadership over computing, biotech, and clean energy.[558]

On February 4, 2023, Biden ordered the United States Air Force to shoot down a suspected Chinese surveillance balloon off the coast of South Carolina.[559][560] The Chinese government denied that the balloon was a surveillance device, instead claiming it was a civilian airship that had blown off course.[561][562] Secretary of State Antony Blinken postponed his planned visit to China as the incident further damaged U.S.-China relations.[563][564][565] In May 2024, the Biden administration doubled tariffs on solar cells imported from China and more than tripled tariffs on lithium-ion electric vehicle batteries imported from China.[566] It also raised tariffs on imports of Chinese steel, aluminum, and medical materials.[566]

In April 2024, Biden signed the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act, which would ban social networking services if they are determined by the president and relevant provisions to be a ""foreign adversary controlled application"". The act explicitly applies to ByteDance Ltd. and its subsidiaries, which are based in China. It ceases to be applicable if the application is divested and no longer considered to be controlled by a foreign adversary of the United States. Biden had signed the No TikTok on Government Devices Act in December 2022, prohibiting the use of TikTok on devices owned by the federal government.[567][568][569]

In October 2023, Hamas launched a surprise attack on Israel that devolved into an intensified conflict, jeopardizing the administration's push to normalize relations between Israel and Saudi Arabia.[570] Biden stated his unequivocal support for Israel and condemned the attack by Hamas.[571] He deployed aircraft carriers in the region to deter others from joining the war,[572] and called for an additional $14 billion in military aid to Israel.[573] He later began pressuring Israel to address the growing humanitarian crisis in the Gaza Strip.[574] Biden rejected calls for a ceasefire but said he supported ""humanitarian pauses"" to deliver aid to the Gaza Strip.[575] He asked Israel to pause its invasion of Gaza for at least three days to allow for hostage negotiations; Israel agreed to daily four-hour pauses.[576] He also directed the U.S. military to facilitate the delivery of humanitarian aid to Palestinians in Gaza.[577] Biden has said he is a Zionist.[578][579] He has faced criticism for his unwavering support for Israel. Officials have urged him to take a harder stance against Israel, criticizing his administration's leniency and support despite the Israeli government's contentious offensive, which has led to significant civilian casualties and humanitarian crises.[580][581][582]

Following the killing of Palestinian civilians receiving food aid on February 29, 2024, Biden said the current level of aid flowing into Gaza was insufficient.[583] On March 3, the U.S. military began airdropping food aid into Gaza.[584] Several experts called the U.S. airdrops performative and said they would do little to alleviate the famine in Gaza.[585]

As of May 2024, Biden has continued to support Israel during the course of the war despite significant domestic opposition to American involvement in it and subsequent widespread protests. A March 2024 Gallup poll found that a strong majority of Americans disapproved of Israeli conduct during the war.[586] Beginning in April 2024, widespread Gaza war protests emerged on university campuses, denouncing Biden.[587]

On May 31, 2024, Biden announced his support for an Israeli ceasefire proposal, saying that Hamas was ""no longer capable"" of another large-scale attack.[588][589][590] The proposal, which would establish a permanent ceasefire, release all hostages, and reconstruct the Gaza Strip, was supported by Hamas officials after mediation by Egypt and Qatar.[591][592] The Netanyahu administration responded that Israel's goals regarding ""the destruction of Hamas military and governing capabilities"" had not changed and that conditions would need to be met before it would agree to a ceasefire.[593][594][595] In the first year of the war, it was estimated that the Biden administration had sent Israel at least $17.9 billion in military aid, a record.[596] In about the same period, it sent Palestinians $1.2 billion in humanitarian aid.[597] In the last week of Biden's presidency, Qatari officials announced that Hamas had accepted the ceasefire deal, with 33 hostages to be released pending Israeli approval. Biden hailed the deal, saying ""it is long past time for the fighting to end and the work of building peace and security to begin"" in a press release the same day.[598][599]

NATO enlargement

Following the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, Biden expressed support for expanding NATO to cover Sweden and Finland.[600][601] On August 9, 2022, he signed the instruments of ratification stipulating U.S. support for the two countries' entry into NATO.[602][603] Finnish ascension occurred on April 4, 2023, but opposition by Turkey and Hungary to Swedish entry led to a stalemate.[604] Biden led diplomatic talks resulting in formal Swedish ascension into NATO on March 7, 2024.[605][606] He has also expressed openness to Ukrainian entry into NATO following the end of the conflict,[607] supporting an expedited timetable in its ascension and the removal of steps such as the Membership Action Plan typically required for NATO entry.[608][609]

Investigations

Retention of classified documents

In November 2022, Biden's attorneys found classified documents dating from his vice presidency in a ""locked closet"" at the Penn Biden Center.[610][611] According to the White House, the documents were reported to the U.S. National Archives, which recovered them the next day.[611] On November 14, Attorney General Merrick Garland appointed John R. Lausch Jr. to conduct an investigation.[612][613] On December 20, a second batch of classified documents was discovered in the garage of Biden's Wilmington residence.[614]

On January 12, Garland appointed Robert K. Hur as special counsel to investigate ""possible unauthorized removal and retention of classified documents or other records"".[615] On January 20, after a 13-hour consensual search by FBI investigators, six more items with classified markings were recovered from Biden's Wilmington residence.[616] FBI agents searched Biden's home in Rehoboth Beach on February 1 and collected papers from his time as vice president, but did not find any classified information.[617] On February 8, 2024, Hur announced that no charges would be brought against Biden.[618]

Business activities

On January 11, 2023, the House of Representatives launched an investigative committee into the foreign business activities of Biden's son, Hunter, and brother, James.[619] The committee's chair, Representative James Comer, simultaneously investigated alleged corruption related to the Hunter Biden laptop controversy.[620]

On September 12, House speaker Kevin McCarthy initiated a formal impeachment inquiry against Biden, saying that the House investigations ""paint a picture of corruption"" by Biden and his family.[621][622][623][624] Congressional investigations, including by the House Oversight committee, have discovered no evidence of wrongdoing by Biden as of December 2023.[625][626][627][628] On December 13, 2023, the House of Representatives voted 221–212 to formalize an impeachment inquiry into Biden.[629][630][631]

In February 2024, Alexander Smirnov, a former intelligence informant who was prominent in the bribery allegations against Biden, was charged with making false statements.[632] Smirnov admitted he had publicized a false story given to him by Russian intelligence officials with the goal of damaging Biden's reelection campaign.[633][634][635]

Age and health concerns

Biden's 81st birthday cake

Biden was the oldest sitting president in U.S. history. His cognitive health was perceived to have declined by Republicans and some media figures,[636][637] and privately by some Democrats. Members of Biden's family and White House staffers insulated Biden from scrutiny of his advanced aging and decline in acuity.[638][639][640]

The media widely covered public concern about Biden's mental acuity after a weak performance in a June 2024 presidential debate,[637] but gave it limited coverage beforehand, in part due to harsh pushback from White House officials.[641] Biden repeatedly said he was fit to serve two terms as president,[642] but later acknowledged that he may have been too old to serve a second term.[643] Upon concluding the investigation into Biden's handling of classified documents, special counsel Robert Hur suggested that Biden would be able to present himself to a jury as an ""elderly man with poor memory"" and wrote that his memory ""appeared to have significant limitations"".[644]

On July 21, 2022, Biden tested positive for COVID-19 with reportedly mild symptoms.[645][646] According to the White House, he was treated with Paxlovid.[646][647] He worked in isolation in the White House for five days[648] and returned to isolation when he tested positive again on July 30, 2022.[649][650] On July 17, 2024, Biden again tested positive for COVID-19.[651][652]

2024 presidential campaign

Ending months of speculation,[653][654] on April 25, 2023, Biden confirmed he would run for reelection as president in the 2024 election, with Harris again as his running mate.[655] On the day of his announcement, a Gallup poll found that Biden's approval rating was 37 percent, with most of those surveyed saying the economy was their biggest concern.[656] During his campaign, Biden promoted higher economic growth and recovery.[657][658] He frequently stated his intention to ""finish the job"" as a political rallying cry.[655][659][660]

U.S. Representative Dean Phillips ran against Biden in the 2024 Democratic presidential primaries,[661] campaigning as a younger alternative who would be a stronger opponent to Trump.[662][663] Biden was not on the ballot in the January 23 New Hampshire primary, but won it in a write-in campaign with 63.8% of the vote.[664] He had wanted South Carolina to be the first primary, and won that state on February 3 with 96.2% of the vote.[665] Biden received 89.3% of the vote in Nevada and 81.1% of the vote in Michigan. On March 5 (""Super Tuesday""), he won 15 of 16 primaries, netting 80% or more of the vote in 13.[666][667] Biden lost the American Samoa contest to venture capitalist Jason Palmer, becoming the first incumbent president to lose a contest while appearing on the ballot since Jimmy Carter in 1980.[668] On March 6, Phillips suspended his campaign and endorsed Biden.[669] On March 12, Biden reached more than the 1,968 delegates needed to win the Democratic nomination, becoming the presumptive nominee.[670][671]

The first presidential debate was held on June 27, 2024, between Biden and Trump. Biden's performance was widely criticized, with commentators saying he frequently lost his train of thought and gave meandering answers.[672][673][674] Several newspaper columnists declared Trump the winner,[675][676][677][678] and polling indicated the majority of viewers believed Trump won.[679] After the debate raised questions about his health and age, Biden faced calls to withdraw from the race, including from fellow Democrats[680] and the editorial boards of several major news outlets.[681][682]

Biden initially insisted that he would remain a candidate,[683] but on July 21, he withdrew his candidacy, writing that this was ""in the best interest of my party and the country"".[684][685] He endorsed Harris as his successor.[686][687] On August 6, 2024, Harris was confirmed as the Democratic presidential nominee.[688] This was the first time an eligible incumbent had declined to run for reelection since 1968.[689]

In the general election, Trump defeated Harris. The Senate went Republican for the first time since 2018. In a nationally televised speech after the election, Biden congratulated Trump and promised a ""peaceful and orderly"" transition of power.[690] In a January 2025 interview, Biden claimed he could have defeated Trump had he not been persuaded to withdraw from the election, despite lagging behind Trump in polling.[691][692] A YouGov poll conducted on November 6–7, 2024, found that if Biden had been the Democratic nominee, Trump would have won the popular vote by 49% to 42%. Trump won the popular vote over Harris by 49.8% to 48.3%.[693]

Assessments

A February 2024 American Political Science Association poll of historians and scholars ranked Biden as the 14th-greatest president, diverging from public assessments. The pollsters noted that Biden's ranking was unusually high for a presidency without military victories or institutional expansion, and with personal scandals such as Hunter Biden's. The experts polled generally regarded Biden's signature accomplishment as his victory over Trump in the 2020 election, which was perceived as helping to protect and restore political and institutional norms in American government.[694][695][696]

Journalist Amy Walter, editor of the nonpartisan The Cook Political Report, argued that Biden's presidency was deemed a failure by the public particularly due to frustration over inflation. Walter said that voters considered inflation the most important factor with respect to the economy, more important than the stock market, low unemployment, or household income.[697] The extent to which Biden's policies were responsible for inflation is debated by economists,[698] but according to Gallup, public perception of the economy in 2024 was worse only in 2008 and 1992, helping Trump win the 2024 presidential election.[699]

Post-presidency (2025–present)

Biden's term ended on January 20, 2025, upon Trump's second inauguration. Biden moved back to Wilmington, Delaware.[700] He later signed with talent agency Creative Artists Agency (CAA) to represent him in public engagements. CAA previously represented him from 2017 to 2020.[701][702]

At the end of his presidency, Biden designated former senior advisors Anthony Bernal and Annie Tomasini to raise funds for the Joseph R. Biden Jr. Presidential Library.[703]

On February 7, 2025, Trump revoked Biden's security clearance, ending his access to classified information.[704] The White House said the decision was part of a broader review of security clearances for former officials. Former presidents have traditionally been granted access to intelligence briefings, though such access is at the sitting president's discretion. In 2021, Biden revoked Trump's security clearance after the January 6 Capitol attack.[705][706]

Political positions

As a senator, Biden was regarded as a moderate Democrat.[707] As a presidential nominee, Biden's platform had been called the most progressive of any major party platform in history, although not within his party's ideological vanguard.[708] Biden says his positions are deeply influenced by Catholic social teaching.[709][710][711]

According to political scientist Carlo Invernizzi Accetti, ""it has become second nature to describe his politics with such ready-made labels as centrist or moderate.""[712] Accetti says that Biden represents an Americanized form of Christian democracy, taking positions characteristic of both the center-right and center-left.[712] Biden has cited the Catholic philosopher Jacques Maritain, credited with starting the Christian democratic movement, as immensely influential in his thinking.[713] Other analysts have likened his ideology to traditional liberalism, ""a doctrine of liberty, equality, justice and individual rights that relies, in the modern age, on a strong federal government for enforcement"".[714][715] Such analysts distinguish liberals, who believe in a regulated market economy, from the left, who believe in greater economic intervention or a planned economy.[714][715] In 2022, journalist Sasha Issenberg wrote that Biden's ""most valuable political skill"" was ""an innate compass for the ever-shifting mainstream of the Democratic Party"".[716]

Biden has proposed partially reversing the corporate tax cuts of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, saying that doing so would not hurt businesses' ability to hire.[717][718] He supported raising the corporate tax only up to 28% from the 21% established in the 2017 bill, not back to 35%, the corporate tax rate until 2017.[719] He voted for the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).[720] as well as the Trans-Pacific Partnership.[721] Biden is a staunch supporter of the Affordable Care Act (ACA).[722][723] He has promoted a plan to expand and build upon it, paid for by revenue gained from reversing some Trump administration tax cuts.[722] Biden's plan aims to expand health insurance coverage to 97% of Americans, including by creating a public health insurance option.[724]

Biden did not support national same-sex marriage rights while in the Senate and voted for the Defense of Marriage Act,[725] but opposed proposals for constitutional amendments that would have banned same-sex marriage nationwide.[726] Biden has supported same-sex marriage since 2012.[91][727] As a senator, Biden forged deep relationships with police groups and was a chief proponent of a Police Officer's Bill of Rights measure that police unions supported but police chiefs opposed.[728][729] In 2020, Biden also ran on decriminalizing cannabis,[730] after advocating harsher penalties for drug use as a U.S. senator.[731][732]

Biden believes action must be taken on climate change. As a senator, he co-sponsored the Boxer–Sanders Global Warming Pollution Reduction Act, the most stringent climate bill in the United States Senate.[733] Biden supports nature conservation. According to a report from the Center for American Progress, he broke several records in this domain.[734] He took steps to protect old-growth forests.[735] Biden opposes drilling for oil in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.[736] He wants to achieve a carbon-free power sector in the U.S. by 2035 and stop emissions completely by 2050.[737] His program includes reentering the Paris Agreement, green building and more.[738] Biden supports environmental justice, including climate justice and ocean justice.[739][740] A major step is increasing energy efficiency, water efficiency and resilience to climate disasters in low-income houses for mitigate climate change, reduce costs, improve health and safety.[741][742] Biden has called global temperature rise above the 1.5 degree limit the ""only existential threat humanity faces even more frightening than a nuclear war"".[743] Despite his clean energy policies and congressional Republicans characterizing them as a ""War on American Energy"", domestic oil production reached a record high in October 2023.[744]

Biden has said the U.S. needs to ""get tough"" on China, calling it the ""most serious competitor"" that poses challenges to the United States' ""prosperity, security, and democratic values"".[745][746] Biden has spoken about human rights abuses in the Xinjiang region to the Chinese Communist Party leader Xi Jinping, pledging to sanction and commercially restrict Chinese government officials and entities who carry out repression.[747][748] Biden has said he is against regime change but is for providing non-military support to opposition movements.[749] He opposed direct U.S. intervention in Libya,[750][209] voted against U.S. participation in the Gulf War,[751] voted in favor of the Iraq War,[752] and supports a two-state solution in the Israeli–Palestinian conflict.[753] Biden has pledged to end U.S. support for the Saudi Arabian-led intervention in Yemen and to reevaluate the United States' relationship with Saudi Arabia.[250] Biden supports extending the New START arms control treaty with Russia to limit the number of nuclear weapons deployed by both sides.[754][755] In 2021, Biden officially recognized the Armenian genocide, becoming the first U.S. president to do so.[756][d]

Biden has supported abortion rights throughout his presidency, though he personally opposes abortion because of his Catholic faith.[759][760] In 2019, he said he supported Roe v. Wade and repealing the Hyde Amendment.[761][762] After Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization, he criticized near-total bans on abortion access passed in a majority of Republican-controlled states,[763] and took measures to protect abortion rights in the United States.[764] He has vowed to sign a bill codifying the protections of Roe into federal law; such a bill passed the House in 2022, but was unable to clear the Senate filibuster.[765][766]

Public image

Biden was consistently ranked one of the least wealthy members of the Senate,[767][768] which he attributed to having been elected young.[769] Feeling that less-wealthy public officials may be tempted to accept contributions in exchange for political favors, he proposed campaign finance reform measures during his first term.[81] As of November 2009 , Biden's net worth was $27,012.[770] By November 2020 , the Bidens were worth $9 million, largely due to sales of Biden's books and speaking fees after his vice presidency.[771][772]

Political columnist David S. Broder wrote that Biden has grown over time: ""He responds to real people—that's been consistent throughout. And his ability to understand himself and deal with other politicians has gotten much, much better.""[32] Journalist James Traub has written that ""Biden is the kind of fundamentally happy person who can be as generous toward others as he is to himself"".[119] In recent years, especially after the 2015 death of his elder son Beau, Biden has been noted for his empathetic nature and ability to communicate about grief.[773][774] In 2020, CNN wrote that his presidential campaign aimed to make him ""healer-in-chief"", while The New York Times described his extensive history of being called upon to give eulogies.[775]

Journalist and TV anchor Wolf Blitzer has called Biden loquacious;[776] journalist Mark Bowden has said that he is famous for ""talking too much"", leaning in close ""like an old pal with something urgent to tell you"".[277] He often deviates from prepared remarks,[777] and sometimes ""puts his foot in his mouth"".[153][778][779] Biden has a reputation for being prone to gaffes,[780] and in 2018 called himself ""a gaffe machine"".[781][782] The New York Times wrote that Biden's ""weak filters make him capable of blurting out pretty much anything"".[153]

According to The New York Times, Biden often embellishes elements of his life or exaggerates, a trait also noted by The New Yorker in 2014.[783][784] For instance, he has claimed to have been more active in the civil rights movement than he actually was, and has falsely recalled being an excellent student who earned three college degrees.[783] The Times wrote, ""Mr. Biden's folksiness can veer into folklore, with dates that don't quite add up and details that are exaggerated or wrong, the factual edges shaved off to make them more powerful for audiences.""[784]

Job approval

According to Morning Consult polling, Biden maintained an approval rating above 50% during his presidency's first eight months. In August 2021, it began to decline, reaching the low forties by December.[785] This was attributed to the Afghanistan withdrawal, increasing hospitalizations from the Delta variant, high inflation and gas prices, disarray within the Democratic Party, and a general decline in popularity customary in politics.[786][787][788][789] In 2023, Biden's approval rating was the lowest of any modern[e] U.S. president after three years in office.[790]

Gallup, Inc. found Biden's approval ratings to be consistently above 50% during his first few months in office,[791][792] but by August, his ratings began to decline.[793] He had a 98% approval rating from Democrats in February 2021, but by December only 78% approved of his presidency.[794][791] By October 2023, his rating among Democrats had reached a record low of 75%.[790][795] His approval rating among Republicans has been consistently in the single digits, aside from his first few months in office.[794] Additionally, Gallup noted that Bi"

Emmanuel Macron, France,en,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmanuel_Macron,"President of France since 2017

Emmanuel Jean-Michel Frédéric Macron (French: [emanɥɛl makʁɔ̃] ⓘ; born 21 December 1977) is a French politician who has served as President of France since 2017. He previously was Minister of Economics, Industry and Digital Affairs under President François Hollande from 2014 to 2016 and deputy secretary-general to the president from 2012 to 2014. He has been a member of Renaissance since he founded it in 2016.

Born in Amiens, Macron studied philosophy at Paris Nanterre University. He completed a master's degree in public affairs at Sciences Po and graduated from the École nationale d'administration in 2004. He worked as a senior civil servant at the Inspectorate General of Finances and as an investment banker at Rothschild & Co. Appointed Élysée deputy secretary-general by President François Hollande shortly after his election in May 2012, Macron was one of Hollande's senior advisers. Appointed Minister of Economics, Industry and Digital Affairs in August 2014 in the second Valls government, he led a number of business-friendly reforms. He resigned in August 2016, in order to launch his 2017 presidential campaign. A member of the Socialist Party from 2006 to 2009, he ran in the election under the banner of En Marche, a centrist and pro-European political movement he founded in April 2016.

Partly as a result of the Fillon affair which sank the Republican nominee François Fillon's chances, Macron topped the ballot in the first round of voting, and was elected President of France on 7 May 2017 with 66.1% of the vote in the second round, defeating Marine Le Pen of the National Front. At the age of 39, he became the youngest president in French history. In the 2017 legislative election in June, his party, renamed La République En Marche! (LREM), secured a majority in the National Assembly. Macron was elected to a second term in the 2022 presidential election, again defeating Le Pen, thus becoming the first French presidential candidate to win reelection since Jacques Chirac defeated Jean-Marie Le Pen in 2002. His centrist coalition lost its absolute majority in the 2022 legislative election, resulting in a hung parliament and the formation of France's first minority government since the fall of the Bérégovoy government in 1993. In early 2024, Macron appointed Gabriel Attal as Prime Minister, youngest head of government in French history and first openly gay man to hold the office, to replace Élisabeth Borne, the second female Prime Minister of France, after a major government crisis. Following crushing defeat at the 2024 European Parliament elections, Macron dissolved the National Assembly and called for a snap legislative election which resulted in another hung parliament and electoral defeat for his ruling coalition. It was only the third time in the French Republic's history that a president lost an election he called of his own initiative. 59 days after the election, Macron appointed Michel Barnier, a conservative political figure and former chief Brexit negotiator, as Prime Minister. Only three months into his tenure, Barnier was toppled by a historic vote of no confidence, prompting Macron to replace him with former minister and centrist veteran François Bayrou.

During his presidency, Macron has overseen several reforms to labour laws, taxation, and pensions; and has pursued a renewable energy transition. Dubbed ""president of the rich"" by political opponents, increasing protests against his domestic reforms and demanding his resignation marked the first years of his presidency, culminating in 2018–2020 with the yellow vests protests and the pension reform strike. In foreign policy, he called for reforms to the European Union (EU) and signed bilateral treaties with Italy and Germany. Macron conducted €40 billion in trade and business agreements with China during the China–United States trade war and oversaw a dispute with Australia and the United States over the AUKUS security pact. From 2020, he led France's response to the COVID-19 pandemic and vaccination rollout. In 2023, the government of his prime minister, Élisabeth Borne, passed legislation raising the retirement age from 62 to 64; the pension reforms proved controversial and led to public sector strikes and violent protests. He continued Opération Chammal in the war against the Islamic State and joined in the international condemnation of the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

Early life

Macron was born on 21 December 1977 in Amiens. He is the son of Françoise Macron (née Noguès), a physician, and Jean-Michel Macron, professor of neurology at the University of Picardy.[1][2] The couple divorced in 2010. He has two siblings, Laurent, born in 1979, and Estelle, born in 1982. Françoise and Jean-Michel's first child was stillborn.[3]

The Macron family legacy is traced back to the village of Authie, Picardy.[4] One of his paternal great-grandfathers, George William Robertson, was English, and was born in Bristol, United Kingdom.[5][6] His maternal grandparents, Jean and Germaine Noguès (née Arribet), are from the Pyrenean town of Bagnères-de-Bigorre, Gascony.[7] He commonly visited Bagnères-de-Bigorre to visit his grandmother Germaine, whom he called ""Manette"".[8] Macron associates his enjoyment of reading[9] and his leftward political leanings to Germaine, who, after coming from a modest upbringing of a stationmaster father and a housekeeping mother, became a teacher and then a principal.[10]

Although raised in a non-religious family, Macron was baptized a Catholic at his own request at age 12; he is agnostic today.[11]

Macron was educated mainly at the Jesuit institute Lycée la Providence[12] in Amiens[13] before his parents sent him to finish his last year of school[14] at the elite Lycée Henri-IV in Paris, where he completed the high school curriculum and the undergraduate program with a ""Bac S, Mention Très bien"". At the same time, he was nominated for the ""Concours général"" (most selective national level high school competition) in French literature and received his diploma for his piano studies at Amiens Conservatory.[15] His parents sent him to Paris due to their alarm at the bond he had formed with Brigitte Auzière, a married teacher with three children at Jésuites de la Providence, who later became his wife.[16]

In Paris, Macron twice failed to gain entry to the École normale supérieure.[17][18][19] He instead studied philosophy at the University of Paris-Ouest Nanterre La Défense, obtaining a DEA degree (a master level degree), with a thesis on Machiavelli and Hegel.[12][20] Around 1999 Macron worked as an editorial assistant to Paul Ricoeur, the French Protestant philosopher who was then writing his last major work, La Mémoire, l'Histoire, l'Oubli. Macron worked mainly on the notes and bibliography.[21][22] Macron became a member of the editorial board of the literary magazine Esprit.[23]

Macron did not perform national service because he was pursuing his graduate studies. Born in December 1977, he belonged to the last cohort for whom military service was mandatory.[24][25]

Macron obtained a master's degree in public affairs at Sciences Po, majoring in ""Public Guidance and Economy"" before training for a senior civil service career at the selective École nationale d'administration (ENA), training at the French Embassy in Nigeria[26] and at the prefecture of Oise before graduating in 2004.[27]

Professional career

Inspector of Finances

After graduating from ENA in 2004, Macron became an Inspector in the Inspection générale des finances (IGF), a branch of the Finance Ministry.[21] Macron was mentored by Jean-Pierre Jouyet, the then-head of the IGF.[28] During his time as an Inspector of Finances, Macron gave lectures during the summer at the ""prep'ENA"" (a special cram school for the ENA entrance examination) at IPESUP, an elite private school specializing in preparation for the entrance examinations of the Grandes écoles, such as HEC or Sciences Po.[29][30][31]

In 2006, Laurence Parisot offered him the job of managing director for Mouvement des Entreprises de France, the largest employer federation in France, but he declined.[32]

In August 2007, Macron was appointed deputy rapporteur for Jacques Attali's ""Commission to Unleash French Growth"".[13] In 2008, Macron paid €50,000 to buy himself out of his government contract.[33] He then became an investment banker in a highly-paid position at Rothschild & Cie Banque.[34][35] In March 2010, he was appointed to the Attali Commission as a member.[36]

In September 2008, Macron left his job as an Inspector of Finances and took a position at Rothschild & Cie Banque.[37] Macron left the government when Nicolas Sarkozy became president. He was originally offered the job by François Henrot. His first responsibility at the bank was assisting with the acquisition of Cofidis by Crédit Mutuel Nord Europe.[38]

Macron formed a relationship with Alain Minc, a businessman on the supervisory board of Le Monde.[39] In 2010, Macron was promoted to partner with the bank after working on the recapitalization of Le Monde and the acquisition by Atos of Siemens IT Solutions and Services.[40] In the same year, Macron was put in charge of Nestlé's acquisition of Pfizer's infant nutrition division for €9 billion, which made him a millionaire.[41][42]

In February 2012, Macron advised businessman Philippe Tillous-Borde, the CEO of the Avril Group.[43]

Macron reported that he had earned €2 million between December 2010 and May 2012.[44] Official documents show that between 2009 and 2013, Macron had earned almost €3 million.[45] He left Rothschild & Cie in 2012.[46][47]

Early political career

In his youth beginning in 1998, Macron worked for the Citizens' Movement for two years, but he never applied to be a member.[48][44] Macron was an assistant for Mayor Georges Sarre of the 11th arrondissement of Paris during his time at Sciences Po.[49] Macron joined the Socialist Party at the age of 24,[50] but last renewed his membership for the period 2006–2009.[51]

Macron met François Hollande through Jean-Pierre Jouyet in 2006 and joined his staff in 2010.[50] In 2007, Macron attempted to run for a seat in the National Assembly in Picardy under the Socialist Party label in the 2007 legislative elections; however, his application was declined.[52] Macron was offered the chance to be the deputy chief of staff to Prime Minister François Fillon in 2010, though he declined.[53]

Deputy Secretary-General of the Élysée (2012-2014)

On 15 May 2012, Macron became the deputy secretary-general of the Élysée, a senior role in President François Hollande's staff.[54][27] Macron served with Nicolas Revel. He served under the secretary-general, Pierre-René Lemas.

During the summer of 2012, Macron put forward a proposal that would increase the 35-hour work week to 37 hours until 2014. He also tried to hold back the large tax increases on the highest earners that were planned by the government. Hollande refused Macron's proposals.[55] In 2013, his was one of the deciding votes against regulating the salaries of CEOs.[56] Nicolas Revel, the other deputy secretary-general of the Élysée opposed Macron on a proposed budget responsibility pact favoured by the Medef.[57]

On 10 June 2014, it was announced that Macron had resigned from his role and was replaced by Laurence Boone.[58] Reasons given for his departure included his disappointment at not being included in the first Government of Manuel Valls and his frustration with his lack of influence on the reforms proposed by the government.[57] This was following the appointment of Jean-Pierre Jouyet as chief of staff.[59]

Jouyet said that Macron left to ""continue personal aspirations""[60] and create his own financial consultancy firm.[61] It was later reported that he was planning to create an investment firm that would attempt to fund educational projects.[48] Shortly afterwards he was hired as a research fellow at the University of Berlin with the help of businessman Alain Minc. He had also sought a position at Harvard University.[62]

Offered a chance to be a candidate in the municipal elections in 2014 in his hometown of Amiens, Macron declined,[63] leading François Hollande to reject Manuel Valls's idea of appointing him Budget Minister, as he had never been elected to public office.[59]

Minister of Economics and Industry (2014-2017)

He was appointed as the Minister of Economics and Industry in the second Valls Cabinet on 26 August 2014, replacing Arnaud Montebourg.[64] He was the youngest Minister of Economics since Valéry Giscard d'Estaing in 1962.[65] Macron was branded by the media as the ""Anti-Montebourg"" due to being pro-EU and much more liberal, while Montebourg was eurosceptic and left-wing.[66] As Minister of Economics, Macron was at the forefront of pushing through business-friendly reforms. On 17 February 2015, prime minister Manuel Valls pushed Macron's signature law package through a reluctant parliament using the special 49.3 procedure.[67]

Macron increased the French share in the company Renault from 15% to 20% and then enforced the Florange law which grants double voting rights on shares registered for more than two years unless two-thirds of shareholders vote to overturn it.[68] This gave the French state a minority share in the company though Macron later stated that the government would limit its powers within Renault.[69]

Macron was widely criticized for being unable to prevent the closing down of an Ecopla factory in Isère.[70]

In August 2015, Macron said that he was no longer a member of the Socialist Party and was an independent.[51]

Macron Law

A law which had originally been sponsored by Arnaud Montebourg before he left the government, and which had focused on ""purchasing power"", grew into the Macron law [fr], a grab bag of measures liberalizing laws prohibiting work on Sunday and at night; restrictions on coaches for public transportation; regulations for debt collectors, barristers and auctioneers; and rules governing the rental of equipment by the military from private companies. The law also sought to simplify many government procedures, such as that for obtaining a driving licence.[71][72] Manuel Valls, fearing that it would not pass in the National Assembly, decided to push the law through with the 49.3 procedure[73][67] and so it was adopted on 10 April 2015.[74]

Estimates of the increase in GDP the law might generate ranged from 0.3% to 0.5%.[75][76]

2017 presidential campaign

Formation of En Marche and resignation from government

Macron first became known to the French public after his appearance on the French TV programme Des Paroles Et Des Actes in March 2015.[77] Before forming his political party En Marche!, he gave a number of speeches, his first one in March 2015 in Val-de-Marne.[78] He threatened to leave Manuel Valls' second government over the proposed removal of dual-nationality from terrorists.[79][80] He also took various foreign trips, including one to Israel where he spoke on the advancement of digital technology.[81]

Tensions around the question of Macron's loyalty to the Valls government and Hollande increased when they turned down a bill he put forward dubbed ""Macron 2"", which had a larger scope than his original law.[82][83] Macron was given the chance to help draft into the El Khomri law and put specific parts of ""Macron 2"" into the law though El Khomri was able to overturn these with the help of other ministers.[citation needed][clarification needed]

Amid tensions and deterioration of relations with the current government, Macron founded an independent political party, En Marche, in Amiens on 6 April 2016.[84] A social-liberal,[85] progressive[86][87] political movement that gathered huge media coverage when it was first established,[88] the party and Macron were both reprimanded by President Hollande and the question of Macron's loyalty to the government was raised.[89][90] Several MEPs spoke out in support for the movement[91] though the majority of the Socialist Party spoke against En Marche including Manuel Valls,[92] Michel Sapin,[93] Axelle Lemaire and Christian Eckert.[94]

In June 2016, support for Macron and his movement, En Marche, began to grow in the media with Libération reporting that L'Express, Les Échos, Le 1 [fr], and L'Opinion had begun to support him.[95] Following several controversies surrounding trade unionists and their protests, Acrimed [fr] reported that major newspapers began to run front-page stories about Macron and En Marche.[96] Criticized by both the far-left and the far-right, these pro-Macron influencers in the press were dubbed ""Macronites"".[97][98]

In May 2016, Orleans mayor Olivier Carré invited Macron to the festival commemorating the 587th anniversary of Joan of Arc's efforts during the Siege of Orléans.[99][100] LCI reported that Macron was trying to take back the symbol of Joan of Arc from the far-right.[101] Macron later went to Puy du Fou and declared he was ""not a socialist"" in a speech amid rumours he was going to leave the current government.[102] On 30 August 2016, Macron resigned from the government ahead of the 2017 presidential election,[103][104] to devote himself to his En Marche movement.[105][106] There had been rising tensions and several reports that he had wanted to leave the Valls government since early 2015.[107] He initially planned to leave after the cancellation[clarification needed] of his ""Macron 2"" law[83] but decided to stay on temporarily after a meeting with President François Hollande.[108] Michel Sapin was announced as Macron's replacement,[109] while Hollande said he felt Macron had ""methodically betrayed"" him.[110] An IFOP poll showed that 84% of those surveyed agreed with his decision to resign.[111]

First round of the presidential election

Macron first showed his intention to run by forming En Marche, but following his resignation from the government, he was able to dedicate more time to his movement. He first announced that he was considering running for president in April 2016,[112] and after his resignation from the position of economy minister, media sources began to identify patterns in his fundraising indicating he would run.[113] In October 2016, Macron criticized Hollande's goal of being a ""normal"" president, saying that France needed a more ""Jupiterian presidency"".[114]

On 16 November 2016, Macron formally declared his candidacy for the French presidency after months of speculation. In his announcement speech, he called for a ""democratic revolution"" and promised to ""unblock France"".[115] He had expressed hope that Hollande would run several months earlier, saying that—as the sitting president—he was the legitimate Socialist party candidate.[116][117] Macron's book Révolution was published on 24 November 2016 and reached fifth position on the French best-seller list in December 2016.[118]

Shortly after announcing his run, Jean-Christophe Cambadélis and Manuel Valls both asked Macron to run in the Socialist Party presidential primary, which he ultimately refused to do.[119][120] Jean-Christophe Cambadélis began to threaten to exclude members who associated or supported Macron following Lyon mayor Gérard Collomb throwing his support behind him.[121]

Macron's campaign, headed by French economist Sophie Ferracci,[122] announced in December 2016 that it had raised 3.7 million euros in donations,[123] three times the budget of then-front runner Alain Juppé.[124] Macron came under criticism from several individuals, including Benoît Hamon−who requested he reveal a list of his donors and accused him of conflicts of interest due to the time he spent at Rothschilds,[125] which Macron dismissed as ""demagogy"".[126] Journalists Marion L'Hour and Frédéric Says later reported that he had spent €120,000 on setting up dinners and meetings with various personalities within the media and in French popular culture while at Bercy.[127] Christian Jacob and Philippe Vigier accused him of using this money to campaign without campaigning.[128] His successor, Michel Sapin, saw nothing illegal about his actions, saying that he had the right to spend the funds.[129] Macron called the allegations ""defamatory"" and said that none of the ministerial budget had been spent on his party.[127]

Macron's campaign enjoyed considerable coverage from the media.[130] Mediapart reported that over fifty magazine covers were dedicated purely to him.[131] Friends with the owners of Le Monde[132] and Claude Perdiel, the former owner of Nouvel Observateur,[133] he was labelled the ""media candidate"" by the far-left and far-right and was viewed as such in opinion polls.[134][135][136] Many observers compared his campaign to a product being sold[137] due to Maurice Lévy, a former Publicis CEO, using marketing tactics to try to advance his presidential ambitions.[138][139] The magazine Marianne reported that BFM TV, owned by Patrick Drahi, broadcast more coverage of Macron than of all the other main candidates combined.[140] Marianne speculated that this might be due to the campaigns links with Drahi through Bernard Mourad.[141][142]

François Bayrou, with whom Macron had been compared, announced he was not going to stand in the presidential election and instead formed an electoral alliance with Macron,[143][144] whose poll ratings began to rise. After several legal issues surrounding François Fillon were publicized, Macron overtook him in the polls to become the front-runner.[145][146]

Macron attracted criticism for the time taken to spell out a formal program during his campaign; despite declaring in November that he had still not released a complete set of proposals by February, attracting both attacks from critics and concern among allies and supporters.[147] He eventually laid out his 150-page formal program on 2 March, publishing it online and discussing it at a marathon press conference that day.[148]

Macron accumulated a wide array of supporters, securing endorsements from François Bayrou of the Democratic Movement (MoDem), MEP Daniel Cohn-Bendit, the ecologist candidate François de Rugy of the primary of the left, and Socialist MP Richard Ferrand, secretary-general of En Marche, as well as numerous others – many of them from the Socialist Party, but also a significant number of centrist and centre-right politicians.[149] The Grand Mosque of Paris urged French Muslims to vote en masse for Macron.[150]

On 23 April 2017, Macron received the most votes in the first round of the presidential election, with more than 8 million votes (24%) and faced Marine Le Pen in the second round, with the support of former candidates François Fillon and Benoît Hamon[151] and the sitting president François Hollande.[152]

Second round of the presidential election

Many foreign politicians supported Macron in his bid against right-wing populist candidate Marine Le Pen, including European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker, German Chancellor Angela Merkel,[153] and former US President Barack Obama.[154]

A debate was arranged between Macron and Le Pen on 3 May 2017. The debate lasted for two hours and opinion polls showed that he was perceived to have won.[155]

In March 2017, Macron's digital campaign manager, Mounir Mahjoubi, told Britain's Sky News that Russia is behind ""high level attacks"" on Macron, and said that its state media are ""the first source of false information"". He said: ""We are accusing RT (formerly known as Russia Today) and Sputnik News (of being) the first source of false information shared about our candidate ..."".[156]

Two days before the French presidential election on 7 May, it was reported that nine gigabytes of Macron's campaign emails had been anonymously posted to Pastebin, a document-sharing site. These documents were then spread onto the imageboard 4chan, which led to the hashtag ""#macronleaks"" trending on Twitter.[157][158] In a statement the same evening, Macron's political movement, En Marche, said: ""The En Marche movement has been the victim of a massive and coordinated hack this evening which has given rise to the diffusion on social media of various internal information"".[159] Macron's campaign had previously been presented a report in March 2017 by the Japanese cyber security firm Trend Micro detailing how En Marche had been the target of phishing attacks.[160] Trend Micro said that the group conducting these attacks was the Russian hacking group Fancy Bear, also accused of hacking the Democratic National Committee on 22 July 2016.[160] 21,075 verified emails and another 50,773 emails it could not verify were released in July 2017 by WikiLeaks.[161] This followed Le Pen accusing Macron of tax avoidance.[162]

On 7 May 2017, Macron was elected President of France with 66.1% of the vote to Marine Le Pen's 33.9%. The election had record abstention at 25.4%, and 8% of ballots were blank or spoiled.[163] Macron resigned from his role as president of En Marche[164] and Catherine Barbaroux became interim leader.[165]

Presidency (2017–present)

First term (2017–2022)

Macron qualified for the runoff after the first round of the election on 23 April 2017. He won the second round of the presidential election on 7 May 2017 by a landslide according to preliminary results,[166] making the candidate of the National Front, Marine Le Pen, concede.[167] At 39, he became the youngest president in French history and the youngest French head of state since Napoleon.[168][169] He is also the first president of France born after the establishment of the Fifth Republic in 1958.

Macron formally became president on 14 May.[170] He appointed Patrick Strzoda as his chief of staff[171] and Ismaël Emelien as his special advisor for strategy, communication and speeches.[172] On 15 May, he appointed Édouard Philippe of the Republicans as Prime Minister.[173][174] On the same day, he made his first official foreign visit, meeting in Berlin with Angela Merkel, the Chancellor of Germany. The two leaders emphasised the importance of France–Germany relations to the European Union.[175] They agreed to draw up a ""common road map"" for Europe, insisting that neither was against changes to the Treaties of the European Union.[176]

In the 2017 legislative election, Macron's party La République En Marche and its Democratic Movement allies secured a comfortable majority, winning 350 seats out of 577.[177] After the Republicans emerged as the winners of the Senate elections, government spokesman Christophe Castaner stated the elections were a ""failure"" for his party.[178]

On 3 July 2020, Macron appointed the centre-right Jean Castex as the Prime Minister of France. Castex, described as a social conservative, was a member of the Republicans.[179] The appointment was described as ""doubling down on a course that is widely seen as centre-right in economic terms"".[180]

Domestic policy

In his first few months as president, Macron pressed for the enactment of a package of reforms on public ethics, labour laws, taxes, and law enforcement agency powers.[citation needed]

Anti-corruption

In response to Penelopegate, the National Assembly passed a part of Macron's proposed law to stop mass corruption in French politics by July 2017, banning elected representatives from hiring family members.[181] Meanwhile, the second part of the law scrapping a constituency fund was scheduled for voting after Senate objections.[182]

Macron's plan to give his wife an official role within government came under fire with criticisms ranging from its being undemocratic to what critics perceive as a contradiction to his fight against nepotism.[183] Following an online petition of nearly 290,000 signatures on change.org Macron abandoned the plan.[184] On 9 August, the National Assembly adopted the bill on public ethics, a key theme of Macron's campaign, after debates on the scrapping the constituency funds.[185]

Labour policy and unions

Macron aims to shift union-management relations away from the adversarial lines of the current French system and toward a more flexible, consensus-driven system modelled after Germany and Scandinavia.[186][187] He has also pledged to act against companies employing cheaper labour from eastern Europe and in return affecting jobs of French workers, what he has termed as ""social dumping"". Under the Posted Workers Directive 1996, eastern European workers can be employed for a limited time at the salary level in eastern European countries, which has led to dispute between the EU states.[188]

The French government announced the proposed changes to France's labour rules (""Code du Travail""), being among the first steps taken by Macron and his government to galvanize the French economy.[189] Macron's reform efforts have encountered resistance from some French trade unions.[190] The largest trade union, the CFDT, has taken a conciliatory approach to Macron's push and has engaged in negotiations with the president, while the more militant CGT is more hostile to reforms.[186][187] Macron's labour minister, Muriel Pénicaud, is overseeing the effort.[191]

The National Assembly, including the Senate approved the proposal, allowing the government to loosen the labour laws after negotiations with unions and employers' groups.[192] The reforms, which were discussed with unions, limit payouts for dismissals deemed unfair and give companies greater freedom to hire and fire employees as well as to define acceptable working conditions. The president signed five decrees reforming the labour rules on 22 September.[193] Government figures released in October 2017 revealed that during the legislative push to reform the labour code, the unemployment rate had dropped 1.8%, the biggest since 2001.[194]

Migrant crisis

Speaking on refugees and, specifically, the Calais Jungle, Macron said on 16 January 2018 that he would not allow another refugee camp to form in Paris before outlining the government policy towards immigration and asylum.[195] He has also announced plans to speed up asylum applications and deportations but give refugees better housing.[196]

On 23 June 2018, President Macron said: ""The reality is that Europe is not experiencing a migration crisis of the same magnitude as the one it experienced in 2015"", ""a country like Italy has not at all the same migratory pressure as last year. The crisis we are experiencing today in Europe is a political crisis"".[197] In November 2019, Macron introduced new immigration rules to restrict the number of refugees reaching France, while stating to ""take back control"" of the immigration policy.[198]

In 2022, the total number of new foreigners coming to France rose above 320,000 for the first time, with nearly a majority coming from Africa.[199]

Economic policy

Pierre de Villiers, then-Chief of the General Staff of the Armies, stepped down on 19 July 2017 following a confrontation with Macron.[200] De Villiers cited the military budget cut of €850 million as the main reason he was stepping down. Le Monde later reported that De Villiers told a parliamentary group, ""I will not let myself be fucked like this.""[201] Macron named François Lecointre as De Villiers' replacement.[202]

Macron's government presented its first budget on 27 September, the terms of which reduced taxes as well as spending to bring the public deficit in line with the EU's fiscal rules.[203] The budget replaced the wealth tax with one targeting real estate, fulfilling Macron's campaign pledge to scrap the wealth tax.[204] Before it was replaced, the tax collected up to 1.5% of the wealth of French residents whose global worth exceeded €1.3m.[205]

In February 2018, Macron announced a plan to offer voluntary redundancy in an attempt to further cut jobs from the French civil service.[206]

In December 2019, Macron announced that he would scrap the 20th-century pension system and introduce a single national pension system managed by the state.[207] In January 2020, after weeks of public transport shutdown and vandalism across Paris against the new pension plan, Macron compromised on the plan by revising the retirement age.[208] In February, the pension overhaul was adopted by decree using Article 49 of the French constitution.[209] However, on 16 March 2020, Macron announced that the draft legislation would be pulled as France went into lockdown to slow the spread of COVID-19.[210]

Terrorism

In July 2017, the Senate approved its first reading of a controversial bill with stricter anti-terror laws, a campaign pledge of Macron. The National Assembly voted on 3 October to pass bill 415–127, with 19 abstentions. Interior Minister Gérard Collomb described France as being ""still in a state of war"" ahead of the vote, with the 1 October Marseille stabbing having taken place two days prior. The Senate then passed the bill on its second reading by a 244–22 margin on 18 October. Later that day Macron stated that 13 terror plots had been foiled since early 2017. The law replaced the state of emergency in France and made some of its provisions permanent.[211]

The bill was criticized by human rights advocates. A public poll by Le Figaro showed 57% of the respondents approved of it even though 62% thought it would encroach on personal freedoms.[212]

The law gives authorities expanded power to search homes, restrict movement, close places of worship,[213] and search areas around train stations and international ports and airports. It was passed after modifications to address concerns about civil liberties. The most punitive measures will be reviewed annually and were scheduled to lapse by the end of 2020.[214] The bill was signed into law by Macron on 30 October 2017. He announced that starting 1 November, it would bring an end to the state of emergency.[215]

Civil rights

Visiting Corsica in February 2018, Macron sparked controversy when he rejected Corsican nationalist wishes for Corsican as an official language[216] but offered to recognize Corsica in the French constitution.[217]

Macron also proposed a plan to ""reorganise"" the Islamic religion in France saying: ""We are working on the structuring of Islam in France and also on how to explain it, which is extremely important – my goal is to rediscover what lies at the heart of laïcité, the possibility of being able to believe as not to believe, in order to preserve national cohesion and the possibility of having freedom of conscience."" He declined to reveal further information about the plan.[218]

Foreign policy and national defence

Macron attended the 2017 Brussels summit on 25 May 2017, his first NATO summit as president of France. At the summit, he met US President Donald Trump for the first time. The meeting was widely publicized due to a handshake between the two of them, characterized as a ""power-struggle"".[219][220]

On 29 May 2017, Macron met with Vladimir Putin at the Palace of Versailles. The meeting sparked controversy when Macron denounced Russia Today and Sputnik, accusing the news agencies of being ""organs of influence and propaganda, of lying propaganda"".[221][222] Macron also urged cooperation in the conflict against ISIS and warned that France would respond with force in Syria if chemical weapons were used.[223] In response to the chemical attack in Douma, Syria in 2018, Macron directed French participation in airstrikes against Syrian government sites, coordinated with the United States and the United Kingdom.[224][225]

In his first major foreign policy speech on 29 August, President Macron stated that fighting Islamist terrorism at home and abroad was France's top priority. Macron urged a tough international stance to pressure North Korea into negotiations, on the same day it fired a missile over Japan. He also affirmed his support for the Iranian nuclear deal and criticized Venezuela's government as a ""dictatorship"". He added that he would announce his new initiatives on the future of the European Union after the German elections in September.[226] At the 56th Munich Security Conference in February, Macron presented his 10-year vision policy to strengthen the European Union. Macron remarked that larger budget, integrated capital markets, effective defence policy and quick decision-making held the key for Europe. He added that reliance on NATO and especially the US and the UK was not good for Europe, and a dialogue must be established with Russia.[227]

Prior to the 45th G7 summit in Biarritz, France, Macron hosted Vladimir Putin at the Fort de Brégançon, stating that ""Russia fully belongs within a Europe of values.""[228] At the summit itself, Macron was invited to attend on the margins by Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif.[clarification needed] Macron, who ""attempted a high-risk diplomatic gambit"", thought that the Foreign Minister of Iran might be able to defuse the tense situation over the Iranian nuclear programme in spite of the recent uptick in tensions between the Islamic Republic and the United States and Britain.[229]

In March 2019, at a time when China–U.S. economic relations were troubled with a trade war underway, Macron and Chinese leader Xi Jinping signed a series of 15 large-scale trade and business agreements totaling 40 billion euros (US$45 billion) which covered many sectors over a period of years.[230] This included a €30 billion purchase of airplanes from Airbus. Going beyond aviation, the new trade agreement covered French exports of chicken, a French-built offshore wind farm in China, a Franco-Chinese cooperation fund, as well as billions of Euros of co-financing between BNP Paribas and the Bank of China. Other plans included billions of euros to be spent on modernizing Chinese factories, as well as new ship building.[231]

In July 2020, Macron called for sanctions against Turkey for violating Greece's and Cyprus' sovereignty, saying it is ""not acceptable that the maritime space of (EU) member states be violated and threatened.""[232] He also criticized Turkish military intervention in Libya.[233][234] Macron said that ""We have the right to expect more from Turkey than from Russia, given that it is a member of NATO.""[235]

In 2021, Macron was reported as saying Northern Ireland was not truly part of the United Kingdom following disputes with UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson over implementations of the Northern Ireland protocol.[236] He later denied this, saying he was referring to the fact that Great Britain is separated from Northern Ireland by sea in reference to the Irish Sea border.[237][238]

French-U.S. relations became tense in September 2021 due to fallout from the AUKUS security pact between the United States, the United Kingdom, and Australia. The security pact is directed at countering Chinese power in the Indo-Pacific region. As part of the agreement, the U.S. agreed to provide nuclear-powered submarines to Australia. After entering into AUKUS, the Australian government canceled an agreement that it had made with France for the provision of French conventionally powered submarines, angering the French government.[239] On 17 September, France recalled its ambassadors from Australia and the US for consultations.[240] Despite tension in the past, France had never before withdrawn its ambassador to the United States.[241] After a call between Macron and U.S. President Joe Biden on request from the latter, the two leaders agreed to reduce bilateral tensions, and the White House acknowledged the crisis could have been averted if there had been open consultations between allies.[242][243][unreliable source?]

On 26 November 2021, Macron and Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi signed the Quirinal Treaty at the Quirinal Palace in Rome.[244] The treaty aimed to promote the convergence and coordination of French and Italian positions in matters of European and foreign policies, security and defence, migration policy, economy, education, research, culture and cross-border cooperation.[245]

During the prelude to the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, Macron spoke face-to-face and on the phone to Russian President Vladimir Putin.[246] During Macron's campaign for the re-election, nearly two months after the Russian invasion began, Macron called on European leaders to maintain dialogue with Putin.[247]

Approval ratings

Approval and disapproval ratings of Macron

According to an IFOP poll for Le Journal du Dimanche, Macron started his five-year term with a 62% approval rating,[248][249] which rose to 64% by 24 June.[250] One month later, Macron suffered a 10% point drop in popularity, the largest at the beginning of a term for any president since Jacques Chirac in 1995, and by August, his popularity had fallen off 24 percentage points since June.[251] This was attributed to his recent confrontations with former Chief of Defence Staff Pierre de Villiers,[252] the nationalization of the Chantiers de l'Atlantique shipyard owned by the bankrupt STX Offshore & Shipbuilding,[253] and a reduction in housing benefits.[254]

By the end of September 2017, seven out of ten respondents said that they believed Emmanuel Macron was respecting his campaign promises,[255][256] though a majority felt that the policies the government was putting forward were ""unfair"".[257] Macron's popularity fell sharply again in 2018, reaching about 25% by the end of November during the yellow vests movement.[258][unreliable source?] During the COVID-19 pandemic in France, his popularity increased, reaching 50% at its highest in July 2020.[259][260]

Benalla affair

On 18 July 2018, Le Monde revealed in an article that a member of Macron's staff Alexandre Benalla posed as a police officer and beat a protester during May Day demonstrations in Paris earlier in the year and was suspended for a period of 15 days before only being internally demoted. The Élysée failed to refer the case to the public prosecutor and a preliminary investigation into the case was not opened until the day after the publication of the article, and the lenient penalty served by Benalla raised questions within the opposition about whether the executive deliberately chose not to inform the public prosecutor as required under the code of criminal procedure.[261]

2022 presidential campaign

In the 2022 election, Macron was the first incumbent to be re-elected since Jacques Chirac defeated Jean-Marie Le Pen in the 2002 election.[262] Macron again defeated Marine Le Pen in the runoff, this time by a closer margin, with 58.55% of the votes to Le Pen's 41.45%.[263] Due to near-record abstentions, this represented 38.52% of registered voters, the lowest figure since Georges Pompidou's 37.5% in 1969.[264] The French far-right received their highest vote total since the start of the French Republic, with nationalist candidates (Le Pen, Zemmour and Dupont-Aignan) winning 32.3% of the votes in the first round and Le Pen achieving a record 41.5% of the votes in the second round.[citation needed]

Second term (2022–present)

Though Macron's second inauguration took place on 7 May 2022, his second presidential term officially began on 14 May 2022.

Borne government

On 16 May 2022, Prime Minister Jean Castex resigned after 22 months as head of government. The same day, President Macron appointed Élisabeth Borne at the Hôtel Matignon, thus making her the second female PM in French history after Édith Cresson between 1991 and 1992. She then formed a new government on 20 May 2022.

2022 legislative election

In June 2022, one month into his second term, less than two weeks before the end of the French presidency of the Council of the EU and days after he called for voters to hand him a ""solid majority"" in a controversial 'tarmac speech',[265] Macron lost his parliamentary majority and was returned a hung parliament in the second round of the 2022 legislative election:[266] Macron's presidential coalition, which enjoyed a 115-seat majority going into the election, failed to reach the threshold of 289 seats needed to command an overall majority in the National Assembly, retaining only 251 out of the 346 it had held in the previous Assembly, and falling 38 short of an absolute majority.[267] Crucially, three close political allies to President Macron were defeated in the elections: incumbent President of the National Assembly Richard Ferrand, Macron's own LREM parliamentary party leader Christophe Castaner and MoDem parliamentary group leader Patrick Mignola, thus effectively ""decapitating"" Macron's parliamentary bloc leadership and further weakening the President's political position in hung parliament territory.[268]

16th National Assembly of France, elected in 2022.

Three government ministers resigned after losing their seats: Justine Bénin (junior minister for the Sea), Brigitte Bourguignon (Minister for Health and Prevention) and Amélie de Montchalin (Minister for Ecological Transition).[269]

Macron's government, still led by Prime Minister Élisabeth Borne, was reshuffled in early July 2022 and continued as a minority administration, after talks with opposition leaders to form a stable majority government failed.[270]

Domestic affairs

Macron's second presidential term began with two significant political controversies. Hours after the new Borne cabinet was announced, rape accusations against newly appointed Minister for Solidarity Damien Abad were made public,[271] and on 28 May, the handling of the 2022 UEFA Champions League final chaos at the Stade de France in Saint-Denis drew criticism at home and abroad.[272]

Despite its minority status in the legislature after the 2022 legislative election, Macron's government passed bills to ease the cost-of-living crisis,[273] to repeal the COVID-era ""state of health emergency"",[274] and to revive the French nuclear energy sector.[275] However, government proposals were defeated several times in the National Assembly[276] and by the end of 2022, the Borne cabinet had had to use the provisions of Article 49.3 of the Constitution ten times in a row to pass the 2023 Government Budget and Social Security Budget.[277]

In May 2024, protests and riots broke out in New Caledonia. On 22 May, Macron visited the island.[278]

Pension reform

In March 2023, Macron's government passed a law raising the retirement age from 62 to 64, partly bypassing Parliament by again resorting to Article 49.3 to break the parliamentary deadlock.[279] Nationwide protests that had begun when the bill was introduced back in January increased in intensity after the reform was passed without a solemn vote.[citation needed][clarification needed]

Votes of no-confidence in the Borne government

On 20 March 2023, Macron's cabinet, headed by Prime minister Borne, survived a cross-party motion of no-confidence by only nine votes, the slimmest margin for such a vote since 1992.[280]

On 12 June 2023, his government survived its 17th no-confidence motion since the beginning of the 16th legislature; the motion, brought by the left-wing NUPES coalition, fell 50 votes short of the 289 votes needed.[281]

Nahel Merzouk riots

In early summer 2023, French authorities faced riots following the killing of Nahel M., aged 17, by a police officer during a traffic stop.[282][283] To calm widespread unrest, comparable in intensity to the 2005 French riots[citation needed], Macron's administration ramped up government response, with a total of 45,000 police officers deployed on the ground and a ministerial order advising courts to apply harsher sentences and accelerated procedures:[284] this crackdown resulted in over 1,300 arrests on the fourth night of unrest alone, bringing the total number of arrests since the riots' beginning to over 2,000 as of 1 July.[285]

2023 government reshuffle

On 20 July 2023, Macron carried out a government reshuffle at the end of the ""hundred days of appeasement and action"" he called for in April 2023 following the violent protests surrounding the passage of his pension system reform. Pap Ndiaye and Marlène Schiappa were sacked as part of the reshuffle.[286]

Defence policy

On 1 August 2023, Macron signed into law a multi-year military planning bill, which set the stage for a 40%-increase in military spending to a total of €413 billion between 2024 and 2030, after it was passed by the French parliament on 13 July 2023.[287][288]

Immigration policy

In February 2023, Macron's government introduced an immigration and asylum bill aimed at removing deportation safeguards, fast-tracking asylum application process and immigration litigation, while also facilitating legalization of undocumented workers.[289] His government later pulled the draft legislation amid fears of defeat in Parliament, instead planning to hold talks with the centre-right LR party before reintroducing the bill in the autumn.[290]

In August 2023, in a lengthy interview with weekly magazine Le Point, Macron said that France ""must significantly reduce immigration, starting with illegal immigration"" because the ""current situation is not sustainable"".[291]

On 11 December 2023, the ""flagship"" immigration bill introduced by Macron's government was unexpectedly defeated after the narrow passage of a motion for preliminary dismissal in the National Assembly.[292] Political commentators and news media described the vote as a ""spectacular debacle"", eventually sparking a major political crisis for Macron's minority administration.[293]

In an effort to salvage the bill, Macron's government sent the draft legislation to a joint parliamentary committee: it resulted in a deal with the conservative-controlled Senate on a drastically hardened bill. On 19 December 2023, the French Parliament passed the piece of legislation thanks to support from the conservative LR and far-right RN parliamentary groups and in spite of a major rebellion from Macron's own coalition and ministers.[294] Health Minister Aurélien Rousseau, whom Macron had appointed to the government only 6 months earlier, resigned shortly after the vote.[295]

Constitutional reform

On the 65th anniversary of the French Constitution on 4 October 2023, Macron unveiled avenues for constitutional reform: broadening the scope and relaxing rules for referendums; enshrining the right to abortion and climate protection in the Constitution; stepping up the level of territorial devolution; giving some form of political autonomy to Corsica and New Caledonia.[296]

On 4 March 2024, a joint session of the French Parliament passed a constitutional amendment supported by Macron to protect abortion as a 'guaranteed freedom' in the Constitution.[297] It represented the first constitutional reform since 2008 and the first since Macron took office in 2017.

Attal government

In January 2024, in the wake of the government crisis produced by the passage of the 'controversial' immigration bill, Macron requested Prime minister Élisabeth Borne to resign and subsequently replaced her by Education minister Gabriel Attal, making him both the youngest head of government in French history and the first openly gay man ever to hold the job.[298]

The new Attal cabinet was widely described as the most right-leaning government since the start of the Macron Presidency: out of the 14 Cabinet ministers appointed on 11 January 2024 by Macron and Attal, 57% are former members of the conservative UMP/LR party, while prominent left-leaning ministers of the outgoing Borne government were sacked, moves described as indicating a notable tilt to the right.[299][300]

Economy

In February 2024, amid slowing economic growth and disappointing unemployment figures, Macron's government unveiled €10 billion in emergency spending cuts to hold to its 2024 deficit goal.[301]

A month later, Macron convened a 'crisis meeting' to discuss the state of France's public finances amid reports showing that the government had heavily missed its 2023 fiscal targets, with a bigger-than-forecasted deficit, putting the country's credit rating at risk of downgrade.[302]

2024 snap legislative election

On 9 June 2024, following the results of the 2024 European Parliament elections in which his centrist grouping received only 14.6% of the votes, finishing nearly 17 points behind Le Pen's RN party, Macron unexpectedly dissolved the National Assembly and called for an early legislative election to be held on 30 June and 7 July 2024.[303]

In the first round of the election, on 30 June, Macron's grouping received only 20.04% of the votes nationwide, placing third well behind the hard-right RN (33.15%) and the left-wing NFP alliance (27.99%), which constituted the worst electoral performance for a governing coalition in a general election since the start of the modern French Republic in 1870.[304] Exit polls released shortly after 8pm on 30 June suggested the RN-led alliance was on course to win either a plurality of seats or an outright majority in the second round, while Macron's coalition was set to lose at least half of the seats it won in 2022.[305]

In the second round, on 7 July, Macron was handed another hung parliament with the left-wing coalition unexpectedly winning a plurality of seats though 90 to 100 seats short of an overall majority, leaving the left theoretically unable to form a government on its own. Macron's grouping lost both 86 seats and its status as the largest parliamentary bloc while the RN-led alliance, though dramatically underperforming the polls, still managed to make significant gains, eventually becoming the largest single party in the new National Assembly. The results presented unprecedented potential for political crisis and parliamentary gridlock.[306]

17th National Assembly of France, elected in 2024.

Shortly after exit polls were released on the night of 7 July, Macron's Prime Minister, Gabriel Attal, announced he would tender his resignation to the President. The following day, Macron refused Attal's resignation, instead asking him to stay on until a new government could be formed.[307]

On 27 August, Macron refused to appoint NFP-designate Lucie Castets as prime minister.[308]

After holding talks with leaders from parties represented in Parliament in an effort to find a working majority, Macron appointed conservative figure Michel Barnier as Prime Minister on 5 September and invited him to form a ""unity government"". Barnier's appointment was seen as a growing sign of Le Pen's influence on French politics since she had previously blocked the appointment of Xavier Bertrand, another conservative figure seen as a serious contender for the premiership.[309]

Vote of no-confidence in the Barnier government

In early December 2024, Prime Minister Michel Barnier resorted to Article 49.3 of the Constitution to pass the 2025 Social Security budget without parliamentary approval. In response to Barnier's move, the National Assembly passed a vote of no confidence on 4 December, effectively bringing down the government Barnier resigned, but Macron vowed to stay in office until the end of his term.[310] It was the first French cabinet to be toppled by Parliament since 1962.[311] Macron addressed the country on 5 December. He accepted the resignation of Barnier and vowed to remain in office until the end of his term. He blamed alliance of 'extreme left and extreme right' for collapse of French government.[312]

Foreign affairs

Macron with Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni in October 2022

On 16 June 2022, Macron visited Ukraine alongside German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and Italy's Prime Minister Mario Draghi. He met with Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and expressed ""European Unity"" for Ukraine.[313][314] He said that the nations that remained neutral in the Russo-Ukrainian War made a historic mistake and were complicit in the new imperialism.[315]

Macron with Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva in May 2023

In September 2022, Macron criticized the United States, Norway and other ""friendly"" natural gas supplier states for the extremely high prices of their supplies,[316] saying in October 2022 that Europeans are ""paying four times more than the price you sell to your industry. That is not exactly the meaning of friendship.""[317]

Macron and his wife attended the state funeral of Queen Elizabeth II in Westminster Abbey, London, on 19 September 2022, and the coronation of King Charles III the following year.[318][319]

On 23 October 2022, Macron became the first foreign leader to meet new Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, just a day after she and her ministers were sworn into office.[320]

During a summit to China with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, which included a formal meeting with Xi Jinping, the General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party and President of China, Macron called for Europe to reduce its dependence on the United States in general and to stay neutral and avoid being drawn into any possible confrontation between the U.S. and China over Taiwan. Speaking after a three-day state visit to China, Macron emphasised his theory of strategic autonomy, suggesting that Europe could become a ""third superpower"". He argued that Europe should focus on boosting its own defence industries and additionally reduce its dependence on the United States dollar (USD).[321] in a follow-up speech in The Hague to further outline his vision of strategic autonomy for Europe.[322] On 7 June 2023, a report by the pan-European think tank European Council on Foreign Relations (ECFR) found that most Europeans agree with Macron's views on China and the United States.[323]

In February 2023, he welcomed Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed in Paris to normalize relations between France and Ethiopia, strained by the Tigray War between the Ethiopian government and Tigray rebels.[324]

Macron at the NATO Summit in Vilnius on 12 July 2023

On 31 May 2023 Macron visited the GLOBSEC forum in Bratislava, where he again delivered a speech on European sovereignty.[325] During the question and answer session that followed the Bratislava speech,[326] he said that negotiating with Putin may have to take priority over any war crimes tribunal which some others, including Zelensky, wish to see.[327]

On 12 June 2023, Macron promised to deliver more ammunition, weapons and armed vehicles to help Ukrainian forces with the ongoing counter-offensive to liberate Russian-occupied southeastern Ukraine.[328] At the NATO Summit in Vilnius, he promised to supply Ukraine with Scalp long-range cruise missiles to hit Russian targets deep behind the front lines.[329] On 10 November 2023, he said that what Russia is doing in Ukraine is ""imperialism and colonialism"" and it was the ""duty"" of France and other countries to help Ukraine defend itself, but added that maybe the time will come to hold fair peace negotiations and find a solution with Russia.[330]

Macron with Israeli President Isaac Herzog in Jerusalem, Israel, 24 October 2023

In June 2023 Macron hosted a global climate finance conference described by many as the new Bretton Woods Conference. The purpose is to adjust the global economy to the contemporary threats of climate change and hunger. One of the propositions is to offer low income countries aid instead of credit so they can use their resources for stopping climate change and poverty instead of debt payments. Macron supported the idea, but a climate activist from Uganda remarked that the promises were meaningless if at the same time Macron supported projects like the East African Crude Oil Pipeline, a major threat to the climate and to the drinking water of 40 million people.[331] At the summit Macron proposed an international taxation system and debt restructuring but stressed it can have an effect only with international cooperation.[332]

In July 2023, Macron postponed his planned state visit to Germany due to the ongoing Nahel M. riots.[333]

Macron and US President Donald Trump at the White House in Washington, D.C, 24 February 2025

In October 2023, Macron condemned Hamas's actions during the Israel–Hamas war and expressed his support to Israel and its right to self-defense.[334][335] On 10 November 2023, he called for a ceasefire and urged Israel to stop bombing Gaza and killing civilians.[336]

In February 2024, during a meeting with other European states, Macron generated controversy by suggesting sending ground troops to Ukraine.[337] On 28 May 2024, Macron gave Ukraine permission to use SCALP EG missiles against targets on Russian soil. Such usage was instructed to be limited ""to neutralize military sites from which missiles are being fired, military sites from which Ukraine is being attacked"".[338] On 24 February 2025, during a meeting with US President Donald Trump, Macron said that a truce between Ukraine and Russia could be agreed in the coming weeks.[339]

Controversies

Uber Files

On 10 July 2022, The Guardian revealed that Macron had assisted Uber in lobbying during his term as the Minister of Economics and Industry,[340] leading to calls from opposition lawmakers for a parliamentary inquiry.[341][342] In his own defence, Macron expressed that he ""did his job"" and that he would ""do it again tomorrow and the day after tomorrow"".[342] He stated, ""I'm proud of it"".[342]

Co-prince of Andorra

As president of France, Macron also serves ex officio as one of the two co-princes of Andorra. His chief of staff Patrick Strzoda serves as his representative in this capacity. Joan Enric Vives i Sicília, appointed as the current Bishop of Urgell on 12 May 2003, serves as Macron's co-prince. Macron swore the Constitution of Andorra through Strzoda in an act that took place on 15 June 2017 in Casa de la Vall.[343]

During the COVID-19 pandemic, the Andorran government asked France for economic aid, but Macron refused, arguing that the Bank of France could not offer loans to another country without the approval of the European Central Bank.[344]

Political positions

Personal life

Emmanuel Macron and his wife Brigitte in 2017

Macron is married to Brigitte Trogneux,[345] his former La Providence high school teacher in Amiens close to 25 years his senior.[346][347][348] They met during a theatre workshop that she was giving when he was a 15-year-old student and she was a 39-year-old teacher.[349][350] His parents initially attempted to separate the couple by sending him away to Paris to finish the final year of his schooling, as they felt his youth made this relationship inappropriate.[14][350] The couple reunited after Macron graduated, and were married in 2007.[350] She has three children from a previous marriage;[351] he has no children of his own.[352] Her role in Macron's 2017 presidential campaign has been considered pivotal, with close Macron allies stating that Brigitte Macron helped him to develop skills like public speaking.[353]

His best man was Henry Hermand (1924–2016), a businessman who loaned €550,000 to Macron for the purchase of his first apartment in Paris when he was Inspector of Finances. Hermand also let Macron use some of his offices on the Avenue des Champs Élysées in Paris for his movement En Marche.[354][355]

In the 2002 French presidential election, Macron voted for souverainist Jean-Pierre Chevènement.[356] In 2007, Macron voted for Ségolène Royal in the second round of the presidential election.[357] During the Socialist Party primary in 2011, Macron voiced his support for François Hollande.[358]

Macron plays the piano,[359] and studied piano for ten years in his youth.[15] He especially enjoys the work of Robert Schumann and Franz Liszt.[360][361] Macron also skis,[362] plays tennis[363] and enjoys boxing.[364] In addition to his native French, Macron speaks fluent English.[365][366]

In August 2017, a photojournalist was arrested and detained by the police for six hours after he entered the private residence where Macron was vacationing in Marseille.[367] Macron subsequently filed a complaint for ""harassment"".[367] In September 2017, he dropped the complaint ""as a gesture of appeasement"".[368]

On 27 August 2017, Macron and his wife Brigitte adopted Nemo, a black Labrador Retriever-Griffon dog who lives with them in the Élysée Palace.[369] As a schoolboy, Macron decided to be baptised as a Catholic. In June 2018, prior to meeting Pope Francis, he identified himself as an agnostic Catholic.[370][371] In the same year he agreed to become an honorary canon of St John Lateran, the cathedral of Rome.[371]

Macron celebrating France's victory over Croatia in the 2018 World Cup final in Moscow, Russia

A fan of football, Macron is a supporter of French club Olympique de Marseille.[372] During the 2018 World Cup, he attended the semi-final between France and Belgium with the Belgian King Philippe and Queen Mathilde,[373] and at the World Cup final against Croatia, he sat and celebrated alongside Croatian president Kolinda Grabar-Kitarović. Macron received widespread media attention for his celebrations and his interactions with the Croatian president.[374]

Emmanuel Macron ([ɛmanɥɛl makʁɔ̃][e] Écouter), né le 21 décembre 1977 à Amiens dans la Somme, est un haut fonctionnaire, banquier d'affaires et homme d'État français. Il est président de la République française depuis le 14 mai 2017 .

Sorti de l'École nationale d'administration en 2004, il devient inspecteur des finances. En 2007, il est nommé rapporteur adjoint de la commission pour la libération de la croissance française (« commission Attali »). L'année suivante, il rejoint la banque d'affaires Rothschild & Cie, dont il devient associé-gérant en 2010.

Proche du Mouvement des citoyens puis du Parti socialiste de 2006 à 2009, il participe à la campagne électorale de François Hollande pour l'élection présidentielle de 2012, qui le nomme après sa victoire secrétaire général adjoint de son cabinet. En 2014, alors encore inconnu du grand public, mais réputé pour sa ligne sociale-libérale, Emmanuel Macron est nommé ministre de l'Économie, de l'Industrie et du Numérique ; en 2015, il fait adopter une loi pour la croissance, l'activité et l'égalité des chances économiques, dite « loi Macron ». Sa notoriété s'accroît alors qu'il prend progressivement ses distances avec François Hollande.

En 2016, il fonde et prend la présidence de son propre mouvement politique, En Marche ! (EM !), et démissionne du second gouvernement Manuel Valls. Il adopte un positionnement qu’il présente en dehors du clivage gauche-droite et se présente à l'élection présidentielle de 2017. Il l'emporte au second tour, bénéficiant d'un « front républicain » face à la candidate du Front national, Marine Le Pen. À 39 ans, il devient le plus jeune président français de l'histoire et le plus jeune dirigeant du G20 du moment.

Son premier mandat est marqué par une réforme du Code du travail, une loi de réforme de la SNCF, l'affaire Benalla, l'affaire McKinsey, la révélation de conflits d'intérêts via les Uber Files, le mouvement des Gilets jaunes et le grand débat national qui s'ensuit, ainsi que par un premier projet contesté de réforme des retraites, la mise en place d'une convention citoyenne pour le climat, la pandémie de Covid-19, puis la crise provoquée par l'invasion de l'Ukraine par la Russie alors que commence la présidence française du Conseil de l'Union européenne.

Candidat à sa réélection lors de l'élection présidentielle de 2022, il affronte une nouvelle fois au second tour Marine Le Pen, face à qui il l'emporte grâce à un nouveau barrage républicain, toutefois plus faible que lors de leur précédent duel. Son second mandat commence par l'obtention d'une majorité relative aux élections législatives, une crise énergétique mondiale liée à l'invasion de l'Ukraine par la Russie, une réforme des retraites reculant notamment l'âge du départ à 64 ans, adoptée sans vote de l'Assemblée nationale et fortement contestée, des émeutes urbaines à l'été 2023 ainsi que le vote controversé d'une loi immigration avec le soutien du Rassemblement national fin 2023.

À la suite des résultats des élections européennes en juin 2024 qui marquent une victoire historique du Rassemblement national, il décide de dissoudre l'Assemblée nationale, déclenchant des élections législatives anticipées. Il perd à cette occasion la majorité relative au profit du Nouveau Front populaire, qu'il refuse d'appeler à former un gouvernement minoritaire, provoquant une crise politique inédite sous la Cinquième République. Il s'accorde avec Les Républicains pour former un éphémère gouvernement dirigé par Michel Barnier, qui est renversé par la motion de censure du 4 décembre 2024, avant de nommer François Bayrou.

Situation personnelle

Origines familiales

La famille Macron est originaire du village d'Authie, dans la Somme. Sa généalogie remonte jusqu'à Philippe Macron, fils de François Macron et de Catherine Authy, né en 1625 et qui exerce l'activité de laboureur, suivie de plusieurs générations d'artisans[3].

Emmanuel Jean-Michel Frédéric Macron est le fils de Jean-Michel Macron, né en 1950, médecin, professeur de neurologie au centre hospitalier universitaire Amiens-Picardie[4] et responsable d'enseignement en médecine à l'université de Picardie-Jules-Verne[5], et de Françoise Noguès, médecin-conseil à la Sécurité sociale[6]. Leur premier enfant meurt à la naissance[7]. Ils ont ensuite trois enfants : Emmanuel, Laurent (né en 1979, radiologue, marié à Sabine Aimot, gynécologue-obstétricienne) et Estelle (née en 1982, néphrologue, mariée à Carl Franjou, ingénieur)[8]. Après avoir divorcé en 2010, Jean-Michel Macron épouse Hélène Joly, psychiatre au CHS Pinel-Dury[9], avec qui il a eu un enfant, Gabriel, né en 2005 et donc demi-frère d’Emmanuel Macron[10].

Ses grands-parents paternels sont André Macron, cadre (chef de district) à la SNCF[11], et Jacqueline Robertson, fille de Suzanne Leblond, native d'Amiens, et du Britannique George Robertson, venu de Bristol pour combattre durant la Première Guerre mondiale et héros de la bataille de la Somme[12]. Ses grands-parents maternels, Jean Noguès et Germaine Arribet, enseignants, sont originaires de Bagnères-de-Bigorre[13]. Son arrière-grand-père Henri Macron, ingénieur voyer, fut maire d'Authie de 1953 à 1964[14].

Enfance

Emmanuel Macron naît le 21 décembre 1977 à Amiens, dans la Somme. Ses parents choisissent son prénom en référence à la prophétie biblique de Jésus-Christ Emmanuel[f],[15].

Il grandit dans le quartier résidentiel de Henriville à Amiens[16]. À l’âge de 12 ans, il demande à être baptisé contre l’avis de son père en déclarant : « Je suis allé tout seul à l’église. Ce fut le début d’une période mystique qui a duré plusieurs années. Après quoi, je me suis éloigné de la religion »[17].

Emmanuel Macron explique sa passion pour les lettres par l'influence de sa grand-mère maternelle Germaine Noguès, une professeure de géographie puis directrice d'école, qu'il surnomme « Manette »[18],[19].

Formation

De la sixième à la première, Emmanuel Macron est au lycée La Providence, un établissement privé catholique d'Amiens fondé par la congrégation des jésuites. Il obtient une « mention régionale » au concours général de français en 1994, alors qu'il est élève en classe de première[20],[21],[22]. Il termine ses études secondaires au lycée Henri-IV, à Paris, où ses parents l'envoient pour l'éloigner de Brigitte Trogneux, sa professeure de théâtre avec laquelle il a une relation. Il réécrit avec elle la pièce de théâtre de l'auteur italien Eduardo De Filippo L'Art de la comédie[23],[24]. Il obtient le baccalauréat scientifique avec la mention « très bien » en 1995[25].

Admis en hypokhâgne et khâgne B/L au lycée Henri-IV, il échoue à deux reprises à l'écrit du concours d'entrée de l'École normale supérieure (ENS)[22],[26].

Il intègre l'Institut d'études politiques de Paris en 1998[27]. D'abord étudiant au sein de la section « Internationale », il se réoriente en troisième année au sein de la section « Service public ». Il sort diplômé de Sciences Po en 2001[28]. Il suit en parallèle un cursus en philosophie à l'université Paris-Nanterre et y obtient successivement une maîtrise en 2000 et un DEA en 2001[29] ; ses mémoires d'études sont dédiés à des penseurs politiques[28] : Machiavel[30] et Hegel[31].

De 1999 à 2001, il est assistant éditorial pour le livre La Mémoire, l'histoire, l'oubli du philosophe Paul Ricœur, qui recherchait un archiviste[26],[32],[33]. Il devient membre du comité de rédaction de la revue Esprit[34]. Certains observateurs mettront en avant l'influence de Paul Ricœur dans les positions politiques d'Emmanuel Macron[35],[36].

Emmanuel Macron n'effectue pas son service national en raison de la poursuite de ses études supérieures, qui reportent sa date d'incorporation. Né en décembre 1977, il appartenait aux dernières classes d'âge encore soumises à l'obligation de la conscription. Celle-ci a, en effet, été suspendue en 1996 pour « tous les Français nés après le 31 décembre 1978 ». Les derniers appelés (environ 4 380) ont quitté leur caserne en novembre 2001[37].

Il poursuit ses études à l'ENA à Strasbourg dans la promotion Léopold-Sédar-Senghor (2002-2004)[38] de laquelle il sort classé 5e [39]. Mais comme l'un des sujets de l'examen final avait déjà été abordé par certains élèves, le Conseil d'État annule le classement final de cette promotion, un recours[40] ayant été déposé par 75 élèves, dont Emmanuel Macron[41],[42]. Pour la première fois depuis la création de l'ENA, une promotion sort donc sans classement final[43], mais cette décision n'aura d'influence ni sur l'affectation d'Emmanuel Macron à l'Inspection des finances[44] ni sur les autres élèves de la promotion[41]. Il fait partie des étudiants militant pour le choix de Senghor comme nom de promotion[45]. À l'ENA, il effectue un stage de six mois à l'ambassade de France à Abuja au Nigeria[45],[46], puis un autre à la préfecture de l'Oise[47].

En 2007, il bénéficie du German Marshall Fund, qui lui permet de découvrir les États-Unis, pays où il effectue par la suite un stage pour la banque Rothschild[48].

Des éléments de sa biographie publiés dans les médias font l'objet d'incertitudes et de contradictions[49]. Ainsi, Emmanuel Macron semble avoir entretenu pendant un certain temps l'ambiguïté sur un prétendu passage par l'École normale supérieure[50]. Par ailleurs, il indique avoir réalisé un mémoire sur l'intérêt général, en rapport avec la philosophie du droit de Hegel, sous la direction d'Étienne Balibar, mais ce dernier déclare ne pas avoir de souvenir ni de trace de cet épisode[51],[33], précisant : « Peut-être s'agit-il d'une censure inconsciente, je ne sais pas »[52].

Vie privée

Emmanuel et Brigitte Macron en 2017.

Mariage

Le 20 octobre 2007 , au Touquet, où il réside[53], Emmanuel Macron épouse Brigitte Trogneux[54],[55], avec pour témoins le professeur d'économie Marc Ferracci et l'homme d'affaires Henry Hermand[56],[57].

Brigitte Trogneux est une professeur de lettres classiques de vingt-quatre ans son aînée[58], qui a eu trois enfants d'une union précédente avec André-Louis Auzière (dont elle est séparée depuis 1994 et divorcée depuis 2006)[59]. Emmanuel Macron l'a rencontrée en 1993, au cours d'un atelier de théâtre qu'elle animait dans son lycée, alors qu'il était âgé de quatorze à quinze ans et en classe de seconde[60],[61],[62].

Religion

Il se définit comme agnostique[63] tout en déclarant : « Aujourd'hui, j'ai une réflexion permanente sur la nature de ma propre foi. Mon rapport à la spiritualité continue de nourrir ma pensée mais je n'en fais pas un élément de revendication[64]. »

Centres d'intérêt

Il pratique le piano, qu'il a étudié pendant dix ans au conservatoire d'Amiens et dont il a obtenu un troisième prix[4],[65],[66], le ski[67] et le tennis[68]. Il a pratiqué la boxe française[32], le football (il apprécie l'Olympique de Marseille) et suit le Tour de France cycliste[68].

En ce qui concerne ses goûts culturels, il apprécie beaucoup le film Les Tontons flingueurs, ainsi que les écrivains Stendhal et André Gide. Il fait ainsi figurer leurs œuvres respectives Le Rouge et le Noir et Les Nourritures terrestres dans son portrait officiel, aux côtés des Mémoires de guerre de Charles de Gaulle[69].

Il cite également Albert Camus, Arthur Rimbaud, et René Char[70]. Ses chanteurs préférés sont Léo Ferré, Johnny Hallyday et Charles Aznavour[70].

Carrière professionnelle

Inspecteur des finances

En 2004, à l'issue de ses études à l'ENA, il intègre le corps de l'Inspection générale des finances (IGF)[44],[71]. Emmanuel Macron devient l'un des protégés de Jean-Pierre Jouyet qui dirige alors l'IGF[72]. Il participe notamment à des missions sur la « valorisation de la recherche »[73],[74], la « fraude aux prélèvements obligatoires et son contrôle »[75] et « la répartition des prélèvements obligatoires entre générations et la question de l'équité intergénérationnelle »[76]. Alors qu'il est inspecteur des finances, Macron enseigne l'économie[77] durant l'été à la « prep'ENA » du groupe privé IPESUP[78],[79],[80]. Il enseigne également au sein de la classe préparatoire aux concours de la haute fonction publique de l'Institut d'études politiques de Paris, où il est chargé d'un cours de culture générale[77],[81].

Laurence Parisot lui propose en 2006, le poste de directeur général du Mouvement des entreprises de France (MEDEF), qu'elle préside, mais Emmanuel Macron décline l'offre, tout en restant en étroit contact avec celle-ci[82].

En août 2007, il est nommé rapporteur adjoint de la commission pour la libération de la croissance française (« commission Attali »)[83]. En mars 2010, il est nommé par décret membre de cette commission[84]. Il y rencontre notamment Peter Brabeck, alors PDG de Nestlé, contact qui lui a permis chez Rothschild & Cie de conseiller le rachat par Nestlé de la filiale de lait infantile de Pfizer en 2012[85].

Emmanuel Macron est co-rapporteur de la commission sur les professions du droit en 2008[86].

Il démissionne de l'Inspection des finances en 2016. En tant qu'énarque, il devait dix ans de services à l'État ; n'en ayant effectué que six (ses deux ans comme ministre n'étant pas comptés), il doit s'acquitter de la somme de 54 000 € [87].

Banquier d'affaires

En septembre 2008, il se met en disponibilité de la fonction publique et devient banquier d'affaires chez Rothschild & Cie [88],[89]. Recruté par François Henrot sur recommandation de Jacques Attali, Serge Weinberg (président du conseil d'administration d'Accor) et Xavier Fontanet (PDG d'Essilor International), il indique que l'échec de son militantisme local dans le Pas-de-Calais, où il n'a pu obtenir une investiture socialiste, et l'élection de Nicolas Sarkozy à la présidence de la République, l'a poussé vers cette activité[32]. À cette époque, il a déjà pour ambition de devenir président de la République, mais, en s'engageant dans le privé, il suit les conseils d'Alain Minc, qui estime qu'il est préférable d'être fortuné pour faire de la politique[90]. L'un de ses premiers dossiers est le rachat de Cofidis, spécialiste du crédit à la consommation, par le Crédit mutuel[85].

En 2010, sous le mandat du président Nicolas Sarkozy, Emmanuel Macron offre son aide bénévole à la « Société des rédacteurs du Monde » (SRM), dans le contexte de la revente du journal Le Monde. Mais il est aussi en relation secrète avec Alain Minc, alors que celui-ci soutient une offre Perdriel-Prisa-Orange, et alors que cette offre paraissait à la SRM « particulièrement dangereuse »[91]. Découvert de manière rocambolesque par Adrien de Tricornot, il doit renoncer à ce double jeu[92], révélateur de sa stratégie médiatique, selon les analyses de Laurent Mauduit et Julia Cagé, fin 2021 sur Off-investigation[93].

Il est promu, fin 2010, associé au sein de la banque, après avoir travaillé sur la recapitalisation du journal Le Monde et sur le rachat par Atos de Siemens IT Solutions and Services[94]. À l'âge de 33 ans seulement, Emmanuel Macron bat ainsi le record de jeunesse d'âge de Grégoire Chertok. Cette ascension rapide apparaît étonnante à certains commentateurs[90], surtout au vu de la différence de bilan entre les deux hommes[95].

En février 2012 , il conseille Philippe Tillous-Borde, le PDG de Sofiprotéol qui prend 41 % du capital de Lesieur Cristal[86].

La même année, il est nommé gérant et dirige l'une des plus grosses négociations de l'année, le rachat par Nestlé de la filiale « laits pour bébé » de Pfizer[85]. Cette transaction, évaluée à plus de neuf milliards d'euros, lui permet de devenir millionnaire[61],[89]. François Henrot dira de lui qu'« il aurait été, s'il était resté dans le métier, un des meilleurs en France, sans doute même en Europe »[88]. L'expression « Mozart de la finance », parfois utilisée une fois le banquier entré en politique, est cependant critiquée par certains observateurs, car son bilan demeure relativement mince[85],[95]. La journaliste Martine Orange, auteur de Rothschild, une banque au pouvoir, indique qu'Emmanuel Macron avait été recruté pour son carnet d'adresses[90].

Entre décembre 2010 , date de sa nomination comme associé-gérant, et mai 2012 , celle de son arrivée à l'Élysée comme secrétaire général adjoint, Emmanuel Macron indique avoir gagné 2 millions d'euros brut[96]. Selon ses déclarations de revenus et de patrimoine faites à la Haute Autorité pour la transparence de la vie publique, il a gagné plus de 2,5 millions d'euros bruts entre 2009 et 2013.

Parcours politique

Débuts (1990-2012)

Militantisme au MDC

À la fin des années 1990, pendant près de deux ans, il milite au Mouvement des citoyens (MDC) de Jean-Pierre Chevènement[96], sans pour autant que son adhésion à ce parti soit établie[97]. Alors à Sciences Po, il effectue un stage au cabinet de Georges Sarre, maire du 11e arrondissement de Paris et proche de Chevènement[98]. Il participe à la campagne de celui-ci pour les élections municipales de 2001 à Paris[99] et vote pour Jean-Pierre Chevènement au premier tour de l'élection présidentielle de 2002[100]. Il explique : « Autant la deuxième gauche m'a inspiré sur le social, autant je considère que son rapport à l'État reste très complexé. Je me suis toujours interrogé sur le rôle de l'État, et c'est pour cette raison que je me tourne, plus jeune, vers Jean-Pierre Chevènement ». À la suite du 21 avril 2002 , il considère que l'échec de Lionel Jospin et du Parti socialiste (PS) s'explique notamment par l'incapacité de la gauche à tenir un discours de fermeté sur les questions de sécurité[97].

Engagement au sein du Parti socialiste

Proche du PS à partir de 2006, les affirmations selon lesquelles il en aurait été membre jusqu'en 2009[61],[101],[102],[g] ont été démenties par la suite[103]. Il collabore également, à partir de 2006, avec la fondation Jean-Jaurès[101], qui en est proche. Par l'intermédiaire de Jean-Pierre Jouyet, il rencontre en 2006 François Hollande, auprès duquel il s'engage à partir de 2010[61]. Lors de l'élection présidentielle de 2007, il fait partie du groupe les Gracques, composé d'anciens patrons et de hauts fonctionnaires, qui appelle à une alliance entre Ségolène Royal et François Bayrou[104],[105]. D'après Anne Fulda, « il dit [en 2016] ne pas se souvenir pour qui il a voté au premier tour mais a déposé un bulletin Ségolène Royal dans l'urne au second »[15]. Selon Raphaëlle Bacqué, Ariane Chemin et Ivanne Trippenbach du journal Le Monde, Emmanuel Macron affirme avoir voté pour François Bayrou au premier tour en 2007[100].

En vue des élections législatives de 2007, il essaie d'obtenir du PS une investiture en Picardie, mais les adhérents socialistes de Picardie s'opposent à sa candidature. Cet échec, associé à la victoire de Nicolas Sarkozy à l'élection présidentielle de 2007, l'encourage à donner un nouveau tournant à sa carrière[106]. Alors qu'il est soutenu par une association locale et par l'opposition municipale de droite du Touquet-Paris-Plage[107], il renonce à se présenter aux élections municipales de 2008[108]. Il indique avoir « décliné une offre au cabinet Woerth en 2007 » car « cela n'était pas conforme à [ses] opinions »[109]. En 2010, il décline la proposition, portée par Antoine Gosset-Grainville et validée par le palais de l'Élysée, de devenir le directeur de cabinet adjoint du Premier ministre, François Fillon[110].

Il soutient François Hollande lors de la primaire présidentielle socialiste de 2011[6] avant l'affaire du Sofitel, alors que Dominique Strauss-Kahn est en tête des sondages[111]. De juillet à décembre 2011, il anime un cénacle d'experts et d'économistes, le « groupe de la Rotonde », composé des économistes Philippe Aghion, Gilbert Cette et Élie Cohen, qui fait un rapport tous les quinze jours à François Hollande, qui gagne la primaire présidentielle[32],[112]. Ce groupe prône « un véritable choc de compétitivité », idée que Michel Sapin, chargé du projet présidentiel, ne retient pas[56].

Premières responsabilités (2012-2016)

Secrétaire général adjoint de l'Élysée

Élection de François Hollande et nomination

François Hollande remporte l'élection présidentielle. Le 15 mai 2012 , après avoir réintégré la fonction publique, Emmanuel Macron devient secrétaire général adjoint de l'Élysée, en tandem avec Nicolas Revel[113],[114]. Il seconde le nouveau secrétaire général, Pierre-René Lemas. Sa nomination à ce poste est suggérée à François Hollande par François Rebsamen, qui rapporte une requête formulée par plusieurs patrons, dont Bernard Attali, Gérard Mestrallet, Jean-Pierre Clamadieu, Jean-Pierre Rodier et Serge Weinberg[115],[116].

Nicolas Prissette indique : « Dès les premières semaines du quinquennat, le secrétaire général adjoint de 34 ans retient l'attention du microcosme : jeune, sémillant, atypique, pas très à gauche. Les journaux lui consacrent des articles. On s'intéresse davantage à ce personnage qu'au secrétaire général Pierre-René Lemas, qui occupe pourtant le poste clé parmi tous les autres, au cœur du pouvoir »[117].

L'été 2012, l'ancienne cellule économique de l'Élysée, dont Macron est devenu le plus haut gradé, étudie un passage temporaire aux 37 heures, jusqu'à la fin 2014, avec un bilan prévu pour voir si les Français peuvent repasser aux 35 heures, étudie une concentration des hausses d'impôts sur les plus hauts revenus, ainsi que le maintien de la défiscalisation des heures supplémentaires. Ces propositions sont déclinées par François Hollande[118].

Emmanuel Macron est notamment l'un des artisans[119],[120], voire à l'origine[121] du crédit d'impôt pour la compétitivité et l'emploi et du pacte de responsabilité et de solidarité[122]. Concernant ce dernier, il s'oppose à Nicolas Revel, chargé des questions sociales, sur l'opportunité d'inscrire le projet dans le collectif budgétaire voté avant l'été 2014[123]. La presse fait également état de dissensions avec Philippe Léglise-Costa, conseiller de François Hollande chargé des questions européennes, ce que ce dernier dément régulièrement[124] ; la revue Contexte indique notamment qu'en 2013, il perd un conflit avec celui-ci alors qu'il plaide « pour une stratégie coup-de-poing face à la Commission européenne, qui réclame à cor et à cri le respect des 3 % »[125]. Il contribue par ailleurs au choix de l'Élysée de ne pas légiférer sur les salaires des patrons et de privilégier un code de bonne conduite[126]. Il confie avoir songé à quitter son poste à l'automne 2013, estimant que la réforme des retraites présentée par l'exécutif n'était « pas à la hauteur »[104]. Il apparaît dans la liste des invités à la réunion du groupe Bilderberg de 2014[127] en sa qualité de secrétaire général adjoint de la présidence de la République.

Une candidature lui est proposée dans sa ville natale d'Amiens lors des élections municipales de 2014, mais il refuse l'offre[41]. Alors que Manuel Valls propose à François Hollande, à l'issue de ces élections, de lui confier le ministère du Budget dans son premier gouvernement, le président de la République écarte cette idée en raison de son absence de mandat électoral[56],[128],[41],[123].

Démission et projets professionnels

Le 10 juin 2014 , l'Élysée annonce qu'il quitte le cabinet de François Hollande et que Laurence Boone reprend les dossiers économiques et financiers. Son titre et rang protocolaire de secrétaire général adjoint de l'Élysée ne sont en revanche pas conférés à celle-ci, qui ne reprend que le titre de chef du pôle économie et finance[129],[130]. Les observateurs expliquent son départ par ses déceptions de ne pas entrer dans le premier gouvernement de Manuel Valls et de ne pas obtenir gain de cause sur l'approfondissement des réformes engagées par le gouvernement[123], ou encore par l'arrivée comme secrétaire général de Jean-Pierre Jouyet, plus au fait des questions économiques, financières et européennes que son prédécesseur Pierre-René Lemas[128],[52]. Alors qu'il espérait récupérer le poste de secrétaire général, il est également déçu de la décision de François Hollande de nommer ce dernier à la tête de la Caisse des dépôts et consignations[52].

Jouyet indique qu'Emmanuel Macron quitte le cabinet de la présidence « pour mener des projets personnels dans les domaines de l'enseignement et de la recherche »[131]. Il cherche, selon les sources, soit à créer une société de conseil financier[132],[52], soit un système multidisciplinaire pour évaluer les élèves[133], soit un fonds d'investissement pour des projets innovants dans le domaine de l'éducation[52], soit aller dans la Silicon Valley monter une entreprise d'enseignement sur internet[134]. Il obtient un poste universitaire à l'université de Berlin au début de l'été 2014 et, avec l'aide d'Alain Minc, le titre de Senior Research fellow en économie politique à la London School of Economics pour y devenir maître de conférences en policy-mix européen ; il se rend une fois par semaine à Londres et Berlin donner des cours[135]. Il cherche également, par l'intermédiaire de Philippe Aghion, à obtenir un poste à l'université Harvard[52],[56]. Après avoir visité des start-up en Californie avec Xavier Niel[48], il s'installe quelques semaines dans les locaux de BDGS, le cabinet d'Antoine Gosset-Grainville, dont il est proche et qui affirmera plus tard : « À l’époque, il essayait de monter une start-up dans le conseil stratégique. Il nous a demandé de l’accompagner sur les aspects juridiques »[136].

Ministre de l'Économie, de l'Industrie et du Numérique

Emmanuel Macron lors de la passation de pouvoir au ministère de l'Économie.

Le 26 août 2014 , Emmanuel Macron est nommé ministre de l'Économie, de l'Industrie et du Numérique dans le gouvernement Valls II en remplacement d'Arnaud Montebourg[137], dont il conserve la moitié du cabinet[133]. Plusieurs personnalités ont été envisagées avant lui : Bertrand Delanoë, Louis Gallois, Gérard Collomb ou encore Pascal Lamy ; il est suggéré par Jean-Pierre Jouyet[52]. Alors inconnu du grand public[138],[139], il devient le plus jeune ministre de l'Économie depuis Valéry Giscard d'Estaing dans le premier gouvernement de Georges Pompidou en 1962[140]. Il est qualifié par certains médias et acteurs politiques d'« anti-Montebourg »[141] et de « symbole » d'un virage social-libéral de l'exécutif[142],[143],[144]. La passation de pouvoir entre les ministres a lieu le 27 août 2014 au ministère de Bercy[145]. Il a pour directeur de cabinet Alexis Kohler, qui fut directeur de cabinet adjoint de Pierre Moscovici de juin 2012 à mars 2014, quand celui-ci était ministre de l'Économie et des Finances[146]. Plusieurs de ses lieutenants sont issus des réseaux de Dominique Strauss-Kahn, dont Cédric O, Benjamin Griveaux et Stanislas Guerini[147].

Loi Macron

Prenant la suite du projet de « loi sur la croissance et le pouvoir d'achat » porté par Arnaud Montebourg, qui se donnait pour objectif de « restituer six milliards d'euros de pouvoir d'achat » aux Français[148], il présente au mois de décembre 2014 au Conseil des ministres, le projet de loi pour la croissance, l'activité et l'égalité des chances économiques, aussi appelé « loi Macron », qui a pour objectif de « déverrouiller l'économie française » en modifiant notamment la réglementation concernant le travail le dimanche, les professions réglementées, les transports et le permis de conduire, l'ouverture du marché autocar[149] et la vie des entreprises et des salariés. Par peur de ne pas trouver de majorité sur ce texte, le gouvernement Valls II décide de ne pas faire voter cette réforme auprès des parlementaires et d'utiliser l'article 49 alinéa 3 de la Constitution, pour la faire adopter[150]. Après son adoption le 10 juillet et une saisine du Conseil constitutionnel par l'opposition[151], la loi est promulguée le 6 août 2015 [152]. Pour son biographe Marc Endeweld, « c'est bien à l'Assemblée nationale [à l'occasion de l'examen du projet de loi] que le banquier de chez Rothschild s'est mué en véritable homme politique, essayant de convaincre jusqu'à ses détracteurs »[153].

L'OCDE estime que les mesures d'Emmanuel Macron généreront une hausse du PIB « de 0,3 % à un horizon de cinq ans et de 0,4 % à un horizon de 10 ans »[154]. À l'été 2016, Ludovic Subran, chef économiste de l'assureur Euler Hermes, estime à seulement un « demi-dixième de point » (soit 0,05 %) l'apport de la loi Macron à la croissance de la France[155]. Elle a pour mesure phare la libéralisation du marché des autocars longue distance, dits « autocars Macron »[156],[157].

Emmanuel Macron défend également certains articles du projet de loi relative à la transparence, à la lutte contre la corruption et à la modernisation de la vie économique, dite « Sapin 2 », notamment sur le statut des autoentrepreneurs ou le seuil de qualification pour accéder à certains métiers. Face à l'opposition qui se manifeste à l'Assemblée, il doit accepter de nombreuses concessions et mobiliser ses partisans[158].

Dossiers industriels

En avril 2015 , Emmanuel Macron fait passer la part de l'État dans le capital de Renault de 15 % à près de 20 %, sans en avertir le PDG, Carlos Ghosn. Il impose ensuite l'application de la nouvelle loi Florange qui permet de donner un droit de vote double aux actionnaires « historiques », ce qui confère à l'État la minorité de blocage. Devant les remontrances de Nissan qui s'inquiète de cette progression au capital, l'État s'accorde à limiter sa puissance au sein de Renault et s'interdit d'agir chez Nissan[159]. En mai 2016, Emmanuel Macron appelle Carlos Ghosn à revoir sa rémunération de 2015 à la baisse en menaçant de « légiférer »[160]. Cet épisode dégradera durablement le climat de confiance au sein de l'alliance Renault-Nissan[161].

En 2015, Emmanuel Macron autorise la privatisation partielle de 49 % du capital de l'aéroport de Toulouse-Blagnac à des acquéreurs privés étrangers. Le bilan de cette cession est sévèrement critiqué par la Cour des comptes dans un rapport publié en novembre 2018. En avril 2019, la cour administrative d'appel estime que la procédure de cession a été irrégulière[162].

Les salariés licenciés de l'usine Ecopla en Isère, cédée à un groupe italien, lui reprochent son inaction, tandis que le député Pierre Ribeaud déplore « une absence de prise de conscience » de sa part[163]. Interrogé sur ce sujet, Emmanuel Macron reconnaît « des échecs » et « des limites à l'action publique » : « le rôle des responsables politiques, ce n'est pas de démontrer en toutes circonstances des capacités, des protections que parfois ils n'ont plus »[163].

Selon l'enquête Uber Files menée par un consortium de médias, les communications internes de la start-up Uber montrent qu'elle a déployé entre 2014 et 2016 une activité intense et en grande partie secrète de lobbying pour faire évoluer favorablement la réglementation et la législation en sa faveur. Emmanuel Macron est en relation directe avec le PDG Travis Kalanick et les lobbyistes de Uber, qu'il rencontre à de nombreuses reprises et en secret, et intervient à la grande satisfaction de la start-up[h] en court-circuitant les décisions de ses collègues du gouvernement et des députés socialistes[164],[165]. En 2017, le lobbyiste qui avait quitté l'entreprise était devenu conseiller senior de son conseil d’administration quand il prend part à la campagne d'Emmanuel Macron et à la création de LREM avec d'autres personnes impliquées dans les discussions avec Uber : Astrid Panosyan-Bouvet (cofondatrice de LREM), Julie Bonamy (ancienne spécialiste du numérique de LREM) ou Fabrice Comptour (considéré par Uber comme l'un de ses meilleurs soutiens au sein de l'exécutif européen)[166].

Selon une enquête de Médiapart, un lobbyiste d'Amazon a participé à des groupes de travail pour préparer la campagne d'Emmanuel Macron[167].

En novembre 2014, Emmanuel Macron autorise l'achat de la branche énergie d'Alstom par l'entreprise américaine General Electric (GE). Plus tôt, l'entreprise avait promis au gouvernement de créer environ un millier d'emplois en France, d'ici fin 2018[168],[169].

Dès janvier 2016, le groupe annonce pourtant la suppression de 765 emplois en France, au siège de Levallois et dans les activités réseaux électriques[170]. Lorsque fin août 2016, GE annonce la fermeture du site d'Alstom à Belfort, Emmanuel Macron commence à s'attirer des critiques, y compris de la part de l'Élysée, de son prédécesseur Arnaud Montebourg et de Michel Sapin, son successeur et ancien collègue à Bercy, qui déclare qu'il « avait levé le pied depuis un an »[171],[172],[163]. Emmanuel Macron quant à lui condamne la décision d'Alstom de fermer le site, affirmant que la question d'une fermeture à Belfort n'avait jamais fait partie des discussions de 2015 entre Alstom et le Gouvernement et qu'il a agi sur le dossier en 2015 pour « éviter un plan social et des licenciements »[173]. Mediapart souligne qu'à Bercy, Emmanuel Macron s'est « privé de plusieurs moyens d'influencer les décisions stratégiques du groupe Alstom, surtout lors du rachat par le groupe américain General Electric de ses activités énergie — il a notamment refusé de se servir d'un décret, adopté en mai 2014, permettant à l'État de s'opposer à une prise de contrôle d'une entreprise française par un groupe étranger. Il a également donné à General Electric un avantage décisif dans les coentreprises détenues par les deux groupes »[163].

En 2016, Emmanuel Macron met en cause « une surcapacité du secteur ferroviaire français » et affirme que l'idée de sauver Alstom « uniquement par la commande publique, c'est une fausse piste sur le moyen et long terme »[174].

General Electric annonce en octobre 2017 la suppression de 350 postes à Grenoble, en juin 2018 un renoncement définitif à sa promesse de création de 1000 postes[169] et en mai 2019 la suppression de 1 050 emplois en France[168]. La gestion du dossier par Emmanuel Macron est alors régulièrement l'objet de critiques[175], reliant notamment l'affaire Alstom avec la désindustrialisation de la France et un déficit de stratégie à long terme[176],[177],[178],[179]. Emmanuel Macron est accusé par le député Pierre Lellouche d'avoir « présidé » la destruction d'un fleuron de l'industrie française en tant que secrétaire général adjoint de l'Élysée puis ministre de l'économie. Emmanuel Macron affirme cependant n'avoir appris le projet de vente à General Electric qu'en avril 2014 lors d'une fuite dans la presse[180],[181],[182], et il déclare le 11 mars 2015 lors d'une audition à l'Assemblée nationale : « Le gouvernement a été mis devant le fait accompli. Les entreprises discutaient depuis plusieurs mois dans le plus grand secret. […] Le gouvernement s'est trouvé face à un projet totalement ficelé »[180],[183],[182]. En 2019, Alain Marleix, député LR et ancien président de la commission d'enquête parlementaire sur les décisions de politique industrielle de l'État, saisit le parquet de Paris en mettant en cause Emmanuel Macron[184]. En 2022, Emmanuel Macron soutient le rachat par EDF à General Electric des anciennes activités nucléaires d'Alstom, dont la turbine Arabelle, composant essentiel des centrales nucléaires et considérée comme un « joyau » technologique français[175],[185],[186].

Visibilité médiatique

Jérôme Fourquet, directeur du département Opinion de l'Ifop, relève qu'« en quelques mois à peine, d' octobre 2014 à février 2015 , la proportion de Français qui ne le connaissent pas passe de 47 % à 18 %. Gagner trente points de notoriété en quelques mois, c'est tout à fait exceptionnel »[187]. Il organise son premier meeting en mars 2015, dans le Val-de-Marne[188].

Tout en donnant l'apparence de la loyauté envers le président de la République, il prend régulièrement ses distances avec celui-ci à partir de son entretien à l'hebdomadaire Le 1 du 8 juillet 2015 [189]. En avril 2015, Le Monde estime qu'à travers ses prises de parole, Emmanuel Macron « assume désormais son social-libéralisme en pleine lumière, même si son cabinet réfute tout changement d'attitude ou de discours »[190]. Fin 2015, il hésite à quitter le gouvernement en raison du projet de réforme sur la déchéance de la nationalité, avec lequel il exprime son désaccord ; il y renonce car celui-ci « ne fait pas partie de [son] périmètre ministériel »[191].

En janvier 2016, il dépose à l'Élysée et à Matignon un projet de loi, dit « Macron 2 » ou « nouvelles opportunités économiques » (NOÉ), qui est annulé par un arbitrage de l'exécutif[192],[155],[193]. Manuel Valls s'oppose tout particulièrement à ce qu'il présente ce nouveau projet de loi, dont le contenu est confié à d'autres ministères[192]. En février 2016, dans le cadre d'une réunion au palais de l'Élysée visant à arbitrer le contenu du projet de loi El Khomri, il accepte de s'effacer au profit de la ministre du Travail, à condition que le projet de loi comprenne deux dispositions qu'il avait prévu d'inclure dans le sien : la réécriture du licenciement économique et le plafonnement des indemnités prud'homales. Si Myriam El Khomri proteste et obtient alors gain de cause selon plusieurs témoignages, ces mesures sont finalement intégrées peu après dans le texte[193],[192]. Selon son conseiller en communication Gaspard Gantzer, qui lui fait cette proposition, François Hollande envisage de le nommer Premier ministre en février 2016[194],[195]. Dans Les Leçons du pouvoir, François Hollande indique à ce sujet : « J’écarte d’emblée ce scénario, non par défiance envers lui mais parce que j’estime que Manuel Valls remplit loyalement son rôle et que je ne dois pas bouleverser l’équipe qui avait tenu le choc du terrorisme »[195]. Au contraire, il est rétrogradé dans l'ordre protocolaire du gouvernement à l'occasion du remaniement réduit de février 2016, à l'initiative de Manuel Valls[196],[197]. Alors que Manuel Valls entre en situation de concurrence directe avec lui dès la fin de l'année 2015, les deux hommes occupant un espace politique similaire, un sondage Odoxa teste pour la première fois les intentions de vote en sa faveur pour l'élection présidentielle en janvier 2016[189].

Le 6 avril 2016, à Amiens, il fonde le parti En marche (qui reprend ses propres initiales, « E.M. »), qu'il veut « transpartisan » et qu'il définit comme étant à la fois de droite et de gauche[198],[199]. Avec cette initiative, il assume pour la première fois son ambition de se présenter à une élection présidentielle[200]. Plusieurs députés lui apportent alors leur soutien[201]. Il est alors entouré d'anciens collaborateurs et soutiens de Dominique Strauss-Kahn, qui trouvent en lui « un honorable produit de substitution » et le suivront sous sa présidence[202]. Ce lancement s'accompagne de tensions avec François Hollande sur la question de la loyauté d'Emmanuel Macron à son égard[199], et d'une dégradation de ses relations avec le Premier ministre Manuel Valls[203]. Emmanuel Macron entretient également de mauvais rapports avec Michel Sapin, ministre des Finances et des Comptes publics[56],[133],[204], mais aussi avec les secrétaires d'État Axelle Lemaire (numérique), dont il a la tutelle, et Christian Eckert (budget)[205]. Bénéficiant alors d'une très bonne image dans l'opinion, il voit celle-ci se dégrader en juin 2016, après une altercation filmée avec des syndicalistes et une polémique autour de son paiement de l'impôt sur la fortune (ISF)[206],[207]. Plusieurs journaux (L'Express, Les Échos, Le 1, L'Opinion) soutiennent plus ou moins ouvertement son action[57].

Le 8 mai 2016, il est invité par le maire d'Orléans, Olivier Carré, à présider les fêtes johanniques, organisées chaque année pour célébrer la libération de la ville par Jeanne d'Arc[208]. Dans son discours, il établit un parallèle implicite entre la vie de Jeanne d'Arc et sa propre trajectoire[209],[210]. En août 2016, il devient le premier ministre d'un gouvernement socialiste à se rendre au Puy du Fou, où il déclare qu'il n'est « pas socialiste »[211].

Démission

Son départ du gouvernement de Manuel Valls est évoqué à plusieurs reprises par la presse à partir de l'été 2015[212]. Il aurait envisagé de démissionner en janvier 2016, après l'annulation de son nouveau projet de loi, puis après le meeting qu'il organise le 12 juillet 2016 , au lendemain duquel Manuel Valls demande son renvoi à François Hollande[192],[213]. Lors de son entretien du 14 juillet 2016 , François Hollande déclare qu'Emmanuel Macron est tenu à la « solidarité » gouvernementale et à la nécessité de « servir jusqu'au bout » sans « démarche personnelle et encore moins présidentielle »[212]. Le 30 août 2016 , il démissionne de ses fonctions de ministre pour se consacrer à En marche[214],[215]. Il est remplacé par Michel Sapin[216]. François Hollande confie alors qu'Emmanuel Macron l'a « trahi avec méthode »[217]. Quelques jours plus tard, Emmanuel Macron déplore le fait que le gouvernement ait « fait beaucoup de choses à moitié », contrairement à ce qu'il préconisait[218]. D'après un sondage de l'Ifop, 84 % des Français approuvent alors le choix d'Emmanuel Macron de quitter ses fonctions ministérielles[219].

Selon Les Décodeurs du Monde, le résultat des réformes lancées par Emmanuel Macron pour « libérer la croissance » est difficilement perceptible[i],[155]. Le produit intérieur brut (PIB) a ainsi « connu des variations irrégulières », avec du « mieux » — 0,6 % de croissance au premier trimestre 2015 et 0,8 % de croissance au premier trimestre 2016 — et du « moins bon » — 0 % de croissance aux deuxièmes trimestres des années 2015 et 2016[155]. Par ailleurs, le nombre de demandeurs d'emploi de catégorie A est passé de 3,41 millions lors de sa prise de fonction à 3,51 millions lors de son départ du gouvernement[155].

Élection présidentielle de 2017

Emmanuel Macron en meeting au Zenith de Dijon pour la campagne de l'élection présidentielle 2017, le 23 mars 2017.

En avril 2016 , Emmanuel Macron fait part de sa volonté de se présenter à l'élection présidentielle[220],[221],[222] et commence à organiser des meetings[223],[224],[225],[226],[227],[228]. En novembre, il annonce officiellement sa candidature puis publie son livre-programme, Révolution[229],[230].

Le 23 avril 2017 , au terme d'une campagne active, onéreuse[231],[232],[233],[234], particulièrement médiatisée[235],[236] et tourmentée par une fuite de documents[237],[238],[239], Macron arrive en tête du premier tour de l'élection avec 24,01 % des voix[240], puis bat Marine Le Pen au second tour deux semaines plus tard avec 66,1 % des voix[241].

Président de la République (depuis 2017)

Emmanuel Macron en mai 2017.

Premier mandat (2017-2022)

Investiture et débuts

Le 14 mai 2017 , Emmanuel Macron est investi président de la République française[242]. Il est le 8e président de la Cinquième République et le 25e président de la République française. Lors de son entrée en fonction, il est, à 39 ans, le plus jeune président français de l'histoire[j], le plus jeune dirigeant du G20 et le plus jeune chef d'État élu démocratiquement, exception faite du micro-État de Saint-Marin[k].

Il confie la fonction de Premier ministre à Édouard Philippe, maire du Havre et membre des Républicains (LR)[245]. Celui-ci forme un gouvernement comprenant des personnalités de gauche, de droite, du MoDem et des indépendants, présentés comme des membres de la « société civile »[246].

Emmanuel Macron ayant déclaré en octobre 2016 que la France a besoin d'un chef de l'État « jupitérien »[247] sur le modèle de Charles de Gaulle et François Mitterrand (par opposition au « président normal » que François Hollande entendait incarner), les médias reprennent largement cette métaphore — en le qualifiant de président jupitérien, voire en le surnommant « Jupiter » —[248] pour évoquer le début de sa présidence et les symboles auxquels il recourt (marche vers la pyramide du Louvre le soir de son élection, remontée des Champs-Élysées en véhicule militaire, tentative de sélectionner la presse accréditée pour les voyages officiels, invitation de Vladimir Poutine à Versailles[249]). Le chercheur Alexandre Eyries estime qu'Emmanuel Macron « affiche un retour aux sources de la Ve avec un pouvoir exécutif absolu »[250],[251].

Le début du quinquennat d'Emmanuel Macron est marqué par l'affaire Richard Ferrand, du nom du ministre de la Cohésion des territoires, accusé de conflits d'intérêts, et par des accusations d'emplois fictifs visant le MoDem, parti de François Bayrou, tout juste nommé ministre de la Justice[252]. Ces révélations interviennent en pleine préparation d'une loi sur la « moralisation » de la vie politique portée par François Bayrou[253]. Sous le feu des critiques, celui-ci, Sylvie Goulard et Marielle de Sarnez ne sont pas reconduits lors de la formation du second gouvernement Philippe, à la suite des élections législatives[254],[255].

Mesures économiques

Emmanuel Macron en 2017 .

Au début de sa présidence, il fait principalement voter des réformes en matière fiscale et en droit du travail[256]. Le quotidien Le Monde indique que si Emmanuel Macron souhaitait à la fois « libérer » l'économie et « protéger » les Français, le premier objectif a « pris le pas » sur le second[257].

Il fait également sortir les valeurs mobilières et les placements (actions, assurance-vie…) de l'impôt de solidarité sur la fortune (ISF), qu'il remplace par l'impôt sur la fortune immobilière (IFI), au périmètre plus limité[258]. Cette mesure, qui coûte 3,2 milliards d'euros au budget français alors qu'elle profite à seulement 300 000 personnes, contribue à sa perception dans l'opinion comme le « président des riches »[259]. Il annonce également la suppression de la taxe visant les Français transférant leur domicile fiscal hors de France (exit tax)[260]. D'après une étude réalisée en 2018 par l'OFCE, les mesures économiques d'Emmanuel Macron auront un effet quasi-nul sur le pouvoir d'achat des classes moyennes et les ménages les plus pauvres verront leur niveau de vie se réduire, alors que les 2 % des Français les plus aisés gagneront 42 % de l'augmentation attendue par l'exécutif[261],[262].

Dans son rapport publié en décembre 2020, le comité d’évaluation des réformes de la fiscalité du Sénat indique que les réformes du début du quinquennat sur la fiscalité du capital « ont eu comme corollaire un enrichissement très marqué des 0,1 % les plus fortunés ». Les dividendes ont augmenté de 60 % en 2018, et cette tendance à la hausse se poursuit en 2019. La fortune des 0,1 % de Français les plus riches s'est ainsi accrue de 25 % entre 2017 et 2019[263].

La Cour des comptes fait part de son scepticisme sur la politique budgétaire menée par l'exécutif, qui suscite en outre l'hostilité d'une majorité de la population[264],[265],[266],[267],[268]. En 2019, le Fonds monétaire international (FMI) exprime son inquiétude sur le mécontentement social et sur le niveau d'endettement de la France (98 % du PIB), indiquant que « la dette française a augmenté au cours des dernières années et [que] le pays dispose de peu de marge de manœuvre en cas de crise »[269],[270]. Cependant, le déficit de 2017 à 2019 se maintient sous les 3 % du PIB, avant une brusque dégradation avec la pandémie de Covid-19[271]. En tout, durant son premier mandat, le poids de la dette publique s’accroit de 600 milliards d’euros en cinq ans pour atteindre 2 950 milliards, soit 44 000 euros par Français. L’endettement de l’État franchit la barre symbolique des 100 % du PIB[272],[273].

Selon les chiffres officiels, le chômage au sens du BIT a baissé jusqu’à 7,8 % de la population active (hors Mayotte) au premier trimestre 2020, soit son niveau le plus bas depuis la crise économique de 2008[274]. Emmanuel Macron voit dans cette baisse « l’efficacité des politiques conduites » notamment pour « réduire la peur d'embaucher » (« flexi-sécurité », réforme de l'assurance-chômage, « investissement dans les compétences » ou développement de l’apprentissage et l’alternance)[275]. Cependant, des commentateurs avancent un simple reflet de conjoncture mondiale, ou l’effet des mesures prises par son prédécesseur François Hollande[276]. Enfin, certaines théories, parfois soutenues par des opposants politiques, prétendent que cette baisse est due à des chiffres manipulés, ou à une hausse des radiations, ce que dément l’INSEE[277]. Pendant la crise du Covid-19, le taux de chômage remonte légèrement[274].

En dépit d’une baisse moins marquée que sur la période précédente, le déclin industriel de la France se poursuit avec la perte de 16 000 emplois salariés entre début 2017 et fin septembre 2021[278]. Pour le quotidien conservateur The Daily Telegraph, « gonflé par ses politiques fiscales confiscatoires et malgré ses politiques commerciales protectionnistes, l'État français n'a pas réussi à empêcher la descente de ses régions industrielles vers un déclin terminal »[279].

Réformes de l'Éducation nationale

En matière d'éducation, Emmanuel Macron met en place un programme prévoyant des classes de CP à douze élèves dans les écoles défavorisées[l],[280],[281], fait voter l'interdiction des téléphones portables dans les écoles et les collèges[282],[283], ainsi qu'une nouvelle formule du baccalauréat, qui doit comprendre une part de contrôle continu à partir de 2021[284],[285], malgré l'opposition du Conseil supérieur de l'éducation du 21 mars 2018 [286]. Après le grand débat national, il annonce qu'aucune nouvelle fermeture d'école n'aura lieu pendant son quinquennat sans l'accord des maires[287],[288].

Politique d'administration de la justice

Sa présidence est marquée par plusieurs polémiques sur l'indépendance de la justice. Il propose, dans un discours prononcé devant le Conseil constitutionnel le 5 octobre 2018 , une réforme de la justice[289]. En novembre 2018, des magistrats dénoncent une « reprise en main politique du ministère public » avec son choix de nommer Rémy Heitz comme procureur de Paris, contre les candidats retenus par la ministre de la Justice Nicole Belloubet[290],[291]. Sa décision de suspendre le volet sur l'indépendance du parquet de la révision constitutionnelle ainsi que les perquisitions médiatisées au siège de La France insoumise interrogent l'opposition[292]. En octobre 2019, il est interpellé après la diffusion d'une note confidentielle du ministère de la Justice envisageant de maintenir ou supprimer des postes de juges d'instruction en fonction des résultats allant être obtenus par La République en marche aux élections municipales de 2020[292],[293].

En juin 2021, il lance des « États généraux de la justice ». Ceux-ci sont secoués par l'affaire Éric Dupond-Moretti, du nom du ministre de la Justice, mis en examen en juillet 2021 pour « prise illégale d’intérêts » par la Cour de justice de la République, une situation inédite dans l’histoire de France pour un garde des Sceaux en fonction[294].

Élections intermédiaires

Les élections sénatoriales de 2017 constituent la première défaite électorale d'Emmanuel Macron[295]. Initialement, La République en marche espérait doubler son nombre de sénateurs, mais ses espérances sont progressivement revues à la baisse, notamment en raison de l'annonce par le gouvernement de coupes budgétaires aux collectivités territoriales[296]. Le scrutin, auquel participent essentiellement des grands électeurs élus lors des municipales de 2014, est un sévère échec pour le parti présidentiel, qui ne parvient pas à remporter de sièges supplémentaires[297],[298]. Ce résultat complique le projet de réforme constitutionnelle d'Emmanuel Macron, car, pour réviser la Constitution, il faut que les deux chambres approuvent le même texte, et que le projet soit appuyé par une majorité de trois cinquièmes des parlementaires (députés et sénateurs)[299].

Aux élections européennes de 2019 — dans la campagne desquelles Emmanuel Macron s'implique fortement[300] —, la liste de la majorité présidentielle arrive en deuxième position avec 22 % des voix, un point derrière celle du Rassemblement national, mais parvient à rallier une part significative de l’électorat Les Républicains[301]. Lors des élections municipales de 2020, la majorité ne remporte aucune métropole : à Paris, pourtant longtemps jugée gagnable, Agnès Buzyn n’arrive qu’en troisième position, tandis que dans d’autres grandes communes les candidats LREM perdent en dépit de nombreuses alliances avec la droite, notamment face à Europe Écologie Les Verts[302],[303]. Cet échec de l’implantation territoriale du parti présidentiel se poursuit à l’occasion des élections régionales et départementales de 2021, LREM et ses alliés n’obtenant aucune région et ne jouant pas de rôle décisif au second tour[304].

Crise sociale des Gilets jaunes

« Acte III » des Gilets jaunes manifestant contre la politique de l'exécutif (Belfort, 1er décembre 2018 ).

À partir de novembre 2018, il est au centre de la contestation des Gilets jaunes, qui commence de façon spontanée après l'annonce par l'exécutif d'une augmentation des taxes sur le prix des carburants au 1er janvier 2019 [305],[306]. Alors que le mouvement fait de nombreux blessés, Emmanuel Macron revient sur la hausse des taxes et annonce notamment l'augmentation du SMIC de 100 euros par mois en 2019[307],[308]. Il lance en décembre un grand débat national et publie le mois suivant une Lettre aux Français[309]. Le 25 avril 2019 , à la suite de ce débat — critiqué par l’opposition pour son manque de représentativité supposé, sa longueur et sa proximité avec les élections européennes —, il annonce son intention de réformer le référendum d'initiative partagée, d'intégrer des citoyens tirés au sort au Conseil économique social et environnemental, de réorganiser l'administration publique, de créer un Conseil de défense écologique, d'augmenter la durée du travail et de réduire l'impôt sur le revenu[310],[311]. Environ trois millions de Français auraient pris part à au moins une manifestation du mouvement des Gilets jaunes[312].

Projet contesté de réforme des retraites

Lors de la campagne présidentielle de 2017, la réforme des retraites est l’un des sujets du programme d’Emmanuel Macron[313], qui souhaite réformer le système par répartition en place. Lancé à la fin de l’année 2019, le projet de réforme fait face à un important mouvement social et se voit repoussé sine die en mars 2020 du fait de la pandémie de Covid-19[314]. En juillet 2021, Emmanuel Macron annonce qu'il souhaite que la réforme puisse garantir un minimum de 1 000 euros par mois, tout en prenant en compte la difficulté des métiers, mais aussi qu’il faut allonger le temps de travail « parce que nous vivons plus longtemps » et mettre fin aux « 42 régimes différents », facteur selon lui d'inégalités majeures[315],[316].

Évolution de sa cote de popularité

Évolution de la popularité d'Emmanuel Macron de février 2017 à mai 2023 .

Emmanuel Macron voit sa cote de popularité de début de mandat s'établir à un niveau compris entre 45 % (selon Elabe) et 62 % (selon l'Ifop) de satisfaction[317]. Sa popularité est ainsi sensiblement inférieure à celles de ses prédécesseurs au début de leur mandat[318],[319].

À l'été 2017, les instituts de sondage font état d'une baisse de sa popularité dans une proportion jamais vue depuis Jacques Chirac en 1995[320],[321]. Selon l'Ifop, sa cote de satisfaction connaît une baisse de 24 points de pourcentage en trois mois[322],[323]. Plusieurs éléments sont avancés par les sondeurs pour expliquer ce phénomène quasi inédit sous la Ve République[324] : mise en place par l'exécutif d'une politique de rigueur ; difficulté à satisfaire sur la durée son électorat, composé à la fois de sympathisants de droite et de gauche ; déclarations jugées humiliantes envers le chef d'État-Major des armées, Pierre de Villiers[323],[325]. Dans une tribune publiée par le New York Times, Chris Bickerton, maître de conférences à l'université de Cambridge, désigne son « attitude arrogante à l'égard du pouvoir » et le « vide de son projet politique » comme raisons de sa perte de popularité[326],[327].

Sa chute de popularité est particulièrement marquée chez les catégories populaires (ouvriers et employés), alors qu'il avait déjà réalisé ses moins bons résultats chez celles-ci au premier tour de la présidentielle ; Jérôme Fourquet de l'Ifop et Chloé Morin de la fondation Jean-Jaurès considèrent que « pour l’essentiel, c’est l’insécurité économique, que la politique menée est perçue comme aggravant davantage, ainsi que le sentiment d’injustice sociale, nourri par un certain nombre d’annonces fiscales récentes, qui sont à l’origine de la fracture qui se dessine entre le représentant d’une France « en marche » et celle qui se sent de moins en moins prise en compte voire, aux dires de certains, méprisée »[328].

Emmanuel Macron aux cérémonies du 11 novembre 2017 .

De novembre 2017 à janvier 2018, les sondages indiquent une hausse continue de sa popularité[329],[330],. Selon Brice Teinturier, ce regain donne une « grande originalité » à la courbe de popularité d'Emmanuel Macron au regard de celles de ses prédécesseurs ; il l'explique par les réformes qu'il mène, le respect de la plupart de ses promesses de campagne et la faible structuration de l'opposition à son égard[331]. Un sondage Odoxa de décembre 2017 indique que la proportion d'opinions favorables à son égard s'établit à 54 %, mais qu'il reste considéré à 67 % comme le « président des riches »[332],[333] ; le même institut indique en février 2018 que 69 % des Français le considèrent comme éloigné des intérêts de la France rurale[334].

Cependant, à l'été-automne 2018, il atteint ses plus faibles cotes de popularité, étant crédité de 21 à 34 % d'opinions favorables, soit un niveau plus faible que celui du Premier ministre, Édouard Philippe, et souvent inférieur à celui de ses prédécesseurs au même moment de leur présidence[335]. Selon Frédéric Dabi, directeur général adjoint de l'Ifop, l'affaire Benalla a été un « déclic pour déclencher une vague de jugements négatifs » mais c'est la politique économique d'Emmanuel Macron qui serait la principale source de mécontentement : d'après lui, « Macron n'est plus seulement dénoncé comme le président des riches mais comme celui qui s'attaquerait aux pauvres, celui dont la politique nuirait aux classes moyennes »[335]. Il souffre également de l'usage d'expressions qui passent pour arrogantes ou traduisant un mépris de classe[m] et de ses critiques envers les Français lors de déplacements à l'étranger[336],[337].

En mai 2020, l'universitaire Bruno Cautrès, sur la base d'un sondage BVA, identifie quatre groupes de Français dont les attitudes diffèrent à l'égard d'Emmanuel Macron[338] :

un premier qui « partage une forte adhésion à sa personne » en valorisant principalement sa « stature présidentielle », mais qui « ne pèse que 6 % des électeurs », réunissant « davantage des hommes que de femmes, des électeurs jeunes (18- 24 ans ) ou des seniors (plus de 65 ans ), des retraités, des cadres supérieurs ou des travailleurs indépendants » ;

) ou des seniors (plus de ), des retraités, des cadres supérieurs ou des travailleurs indépendants » ; un deuxième qui « est celui d’un soutien positif mais plus modéré à Emmanuel Macron », représente 26 % des Français interrogés par BVA et « partage plusieurs traits avec le groupe des « macronistes convaincus » » en étant « plus diversifié » ;

en étant « plus diversifié » ; un troisième présenté comme celui des « opposants modérés », se situant « plutôt à gauche », regroupant « 41 % des personnes interrogées, soit le groupe le plus nombreux », « avant tout composé de catégories sociales intermédiaires ou populaires (ouvriers), de chômeurs, plutôt des femmes que des hommes, des 35- 49 ans ou des étudiants » ;

ou des étudiants » ; un quatrième présenté comme celui des « opposants convaincus », plutôt proches du RN, de LFI, plus rarement d'autres partis de gauche, représentant 27 % des personnes interrogées, « composé de classes moyennes plutôt basses, de catégories populaires (ouvriers, employés), ou de petits indépendants, généralement âgés ou retraités » et peu favorables à l'intégration européenne.

La pandémie de Covid-19 et le confinement qui s’ensuit lui permettent dans un premier temps de connaître une hausse de popularité inédite sous sa présidence, même s’il reste en deçà du niveau d'opinions favorables de ses débuts. Cependant, peu avant le déconfinement, en mai 2020, sa cote s’érode à nouveau alors que celle d’Édouard Philippe continue de croître, dépassant celle du chef de l’État de façon encore plus nette qu’auparavant. Pascal Perrineau, directeur du CEVIPOF, explique cette situation par son « hyperprésidence » et une « dimension personnelle » : alors que le président est avant tout perçu comme « arrogant », « autoritaire » et « changeant », le chef du gouvernement est vu davantage comme « rassurant », « tenace » et « authentique »[339].

En avril 2022, une nette majorité de Français se dit insatisfaite du bilan d'Emmanuel Macron, selon un sondage YouGov[340]. En mars 2024, Emmanuel Macron satisfait 28 % des Français et en mécontente 72 %. Selon Frédéric Dabi, directeur de l'Ifop, « le mécontentement très vif à l'égard du président se concentre principalement sur l'Ukraine et la question de l'envoi de troupes » occidentales au sol[341]. En octobre 2024, sa cote de confiance tombe à 17 % se situant en dessous de son niveau lors de la crise des « gilets jaunes »[342].

Gestion de la pandémie de Covid-19

Le 24 janvier 2020 , trois premiers cas de maladie à coronavirus 2019 (Covid-19), un virus découvert le mois précédent dans la ville de Wuhan (Chine), sont recensés en France[343]. Alors que le nombre de malades se multiplie, Emmanuel Macron, en concertation avec l’opposition, décide de maintenir le premier tour des élections municipales au 15 mars 2020 . Au lendemain d'un vote marqué par un taux d’abstention record, Emmanuel Macron annonce, afin de stopper la diffusion exponentielle du virus, que la population sera confinée à domicile à partir du lendemain et que tous les lieux recevant du public considérés comme non indispensables à la vie seront fermés ; il déclare à plusieurs reprises que le pays est « en guerre » et fait savoir que le second tour des municipales est repoussé sine die.

Emmanuel Macron portant un masque de protection en novembre 2020.

Le 17 décembre 2020 , l'Élysée annonce qu'Emmanuel Macron a été testé positif à la Covid-19[344]. Un dîner ayant eu lieu la veille du diagnostic suscite une polémique pour avoir réuni plus de six convives, seuil maximal recommandé par le président lui-même, bien que les règles de distanciation physique aient été respectées selon l'Élysée[345]. Le président de la République s'isole alors à La Lanterne, à Versailles, où il continue de travailler. Après sept jours d'isolement, la présidence annonce qu’il ne présente plus de symptômes, ce qui lui permet de regagner le palais de l'Élysée[346],[347].

En novembre 2020, face à une nouvelle augmentation du nombre de cas, un second confinement national est décrété par Emmanuel Macron.

Une campagne de vaccination se met en place, mais l’Union européenne souffre de lenteurs administratives importantes. Le 15 mars 2021 , en raison d’effets secondaires aigus sur plusieurs personnes dans le monde et à la suite d’une décision similaire de l'Allemagne, le président de la République annonce que la France suspend la vaccination par le vaccin AstraZeneca en attendant la recommandation officielle de l'Agence européenne des médicaments (AEM)[348], qui émet finalement une recommandation en faveur du vaccin[349].

Le 31 mars 2021 , alors qu’il avait refusé un troisième confinement national à la fin du mois de janvier précédent contre notamment l’avis du Conseil scientifique Covid-19[350],[351], Emmanuel Macron annonce l'extension des mesures de confinement déjà en vigueur dans seize départements à tout le territoire métropolitain, ainsi que la fermeture des crèches, écoles, collèges et lycées[352]. Il fait lever progressivement les restrictions sanitaires à compter du 3 mai suivant. Selon Le Monde, son choix de reporter les mesures réclamées dès janvier par des scientifiques a généré plus de 14 000 décès et 112 000 hospitalisations supplémentaires[353].

Les mesures décidées par l’exécutif, similaires à celles prises dans de nombreux pays, ont des conséquences économiques, sociales et environnementales importantes et font peser des incertitudes sur les droits fondamentaux de la population. En contrepartie, Emmanuel Macron multiplie les aides publiques aux entreprises et aux particuliers, sa formule du « quoi qu'il en coûte » — qui s’absout du principe d’équilibre des finances publiques — devenant le leitmotiv du gouvernement[354]. Elle se traduit notamment par des déficits et une dégradation des finances publiques[278].

Le 12 juillet 2021, souhaitant rendre maximale l'incitation de la vaccination contre la Covid, Emmanuel Macron annonce l’extension de l’obligation de présentation d’un « passe sanitaire » à de nombreux lieux de la vie quotidienne (bars, restaurants, hôpitaux, trains et bus pour les trajets de longue distance, etc.)[355]. Ces annonces, considérées comme un moyen de rendre la vaccination obligatoire de fait et réduisant la liberté de chacun, entraînent de nombreuses manifestations dans le pays[356],[357]. La Défenseure des droits, Claire Hédon, émet des réserves concernant le projet de loi et pointe de nombreux points allant à l'encontre des libertés publiques[358],[359]. Le projet suscite de nouveau de vives réactions et nombreuses manifestations d’opposition[360],[361]. Le 5 août, après adoption par le Parlement, le Conseil constitutionnel ne juge pas inconstitutionnelles l'extension du passe sanitaire et la vaccination obligatoire pour le personnel soignant, mais censure l'isolement obligatoire des malades, de même que la rupture anticipée d'un CDD ou d'un contrat d'intérim en cas de non-présentation du passe[362].

Relations avec l'Union européenne

Emmanuel Macron suscite une crise diplomatique avec la Pologne en août 2017, alors qu'il souhaite modifier le statut des travailleurs détachés contre la volonté du gouvernement polonais : il déclare que « la Pologne n'est en rien ce qui définit le cap de l'Europe » et que « le peuple polonais mérite mieux » que la position adoptée par sa présidente du Conseil des ministres, Beata Szydło[363],[364],[365] ; en retour, celle-ci dénonce l'« arrogance » du président français, ajoutant qu'il devrait essayer d'« avoir les mêmes résultats économiques et le même niveau de sécurité de ses citoyens que ceux garantis par la Pologne »[365].

En avril 2018, Angela Merkel, présentée comme sa principale alliée, s'oppose publiquement à son souhait de doter la zone euro d'une capacité budgétaire. La chancelière allemande voit dans ce projet le risque que les pays du Sud de la zone relâchent leur effort budgétaire[366].

Sur la crise migratoire, Emmanuel Macron fait face à l'opposition de plusieurs pays européens hostiles à l'accueil de migrants, dont la Hongrie, la Pologne, la République tchèque et l'Autriche[367],[368]. Fin 2018, il qualifie les dirigeants hongrois et polonais d'« esprits fous » qui « mentent à leur peuple »[369]. L'opposition entre Emmanuel Macron et Viktor Orbán est soulignée par les médias, qui indiquent qu'ils essaient de reconfigurer la vie politique européenne autour de leurs figures respectives[370].

En vue des élections européennes de 2019, il fait publier une tribune dans les 28 pays de l'UE, mais celle-ci reçoit un accueil mitigé : la Commission européenne rappelle que plusieurs des propositions du président français sont déjà en place tandis que plusieurs États jugent ses mesures confuses ou irréalistes[371],[372].

En 2019, Le Figaro relève que le budget de la zone euro reste très mince, qu'aucun mécanisme de stabilisation en cas de crise économique n'a été mis en place, que le projet français de taxe sur les géants du numérique n'a pas abouti et que la France est isolée sur la question du Brexit[373]. En effet, Emmanuel Macron se montre parmi les plus intransigeants sur la question du retrait du Royaume-Uni, ce qui l'isole au sein des dirigeants européens et fait dire à la presse britannique qu'il est le principal responsable de l'enlisement des négociations entre le Royaume-Uni et l'UE[374],[375],[376].

Il échoue à établir des listes transnationales aux élections européennes de 2019[377]. En juin et juillet 2019, alors que l'influence française se trouve réduite au sein de la neuvième législature du Parlement européen, il fait en sorte d'écarter de la course à la présidence de la Commission européenne la candidature de Manfred Weber, pourtant désigné spitzenkandidat par le PPE, arrivé en tête du scrutin. Cette attitude lui vaut des critiques[Qui ?] sur sa conception de la démocratie européenne et les reproches de plusieurs de ses partenaires européens, notamment de l'Allemagne et de la Belgique, sur une gestion jugée peu diplomatique et solitaire[373]. Il suggère à Angela Merkel le nom d'Ursula von der Leyen, finalement désignée[378]. En octobre 2019, fait inédit pour la France, le Parlement européen rejette la candidature de Sylvie Goulard car elle faisait l'objet de deux enquêtes pour des soupçons d'emplois fictifs. Emmanuel Macron l'avait proposée pour devenir commissaire européenne dans la commission Von der Leyen[379],[380].

Longtemps réticent à un nouvel élargissement de l'Union européenne, préférant « approfondir » l’UE à 27, il acte son changement de position lors du sommet de Bratislava du forum Globsec le 31 mai 2023 : il soutient les candidatures des pays des Balkans occidentaux, ainsi que l’ouverture de négociations officielles en vue d’une adhésion de l’Ukraine et de la Moldavie[381].

Politique étrangère et diplomatie

Emmanuel Macron et Donald Trump lors d'un sommet de l'OTAN, en 2018.

Le 1er juin 2017 , il s'élève contre la décision de Donald Trump de retirer les États-Unis de l'accord de Paris sur le climat, lors d'une allocution télévisée qu'il prononce en français puis en anglais[n],[382],[383]. Il conclut son intervention en paraphrasant le slogan de campagne du président américain Trump (« Make America Great Again », également slogan de la campagne victorieuse de Ronald Reagan en 1980) par « Make our Planet Great Again », une formule qui fait le tour du monde[384] et bat le record de partages sur Twitter pour un compte français[385].

En novembre 2018, Emmanuel Macron évoque l'idée d'une armée européenne, ce qui lui attire les critiques du président américain alors que l'entente entre les deux hommes était jusqu'ici soulignée[386],[387].

En novembre 2017, il s'investit dans la crise au Liban, où le Premier ministre Saad Hariri avait démissionné, sous la pression de l'Arabie saoudite selon certains[388].

Dans le cadre de la guerre civile syrienne, Emmanuel Macron reste sur une ligne proche de celle de François Hollande[389],[390] : il réaffirme son soutien à l'opposition syrienne[391],[392] mais change cependant de rhétorique en affirmant ouvertement ne pas vouloir faire de « la destitution de Bachar el-Assad une condition préalable à des discussions. […] Daech est notre ennemi, Bachar est l'ennemi du peuple syrien »[393],[394],[395],[389],[396].

Élu peu après l'attaque chimique de Khan Cheikhoun, Emmanuel Macron déclare, le 29 mai 2017 , qu'une nouvelle utilisation d'armes chimiques en Syrie serait une « ligne rouge » qui, si elle était franchie, ferait l'objet d'une « riposte immédiate »[397]. Une semaine après l'attaque chimique de Douma du 7 avril 2018 , la France participe à des bombardements contre des sites liés au programme d'armement chimique syrien[398]. Emmanuel Macron affirme alors que la France détient des « preuves » de l'usage d'armes chimiques contre des civils par le régime de Bachar el-Assad[399]. Cette riposte est soutenue par le Parti socialiste, mais condamnée par le Front national et La France insoumise, tandis que Les Républicains sont divisés[400],[401],[402]. Parmi eux, plusieurs personnalités appellent à la divulgation des « preuves » évoquées par Emmanuel Macron et dénoncent une intervention sans mandat de l'ONU ni vote du Parlement[399],[403].

Plusieurs analystes notent la perte d'influence de la France sur le continent africain[279] en compétition notamment avec la diplomatie russe[404] ou chinoise[405]. Confrontée à des pays comme la Chine, l’Inde ou l’Allemagne, la France voit son influence s’éroder, en particulier sur les plans économique et commercial[406].

Au Mali, confronté à l’hostilité de la junte au pouvoir[407], Emmanuel Macron est contraint d’annoncer en 2022 le retrait des troupes françaises du pays[408]. Cette décision sonne la fin de l’opération Barkhane et, selon Rémi Carayol, illustre « l’échec de la France à sortir de cette guerre par le haut »[409]. Renaud Girard considère également, qu'au bout de huit ans, l'opération Barkhane n'a pas obtenu de « résultat patent »[410].

Lors de son premier discours à l'ONU, le 19 septembre 2017 , Emmanuel Macron défend une vision « multilatéraliste » des relations internationales[411].

En mars 2019, Michelle Bachelet, haut-commissaire des Nations unies aux droits de l'homme, demande une enquête sur les cas rapportés d'« usage excessif de la force » et violences policières face au mouvement des Gilets jaunes. Le Gouvernement français s'étonne de trouver la France sur une liste qui comporte des régimes autoritaires comme le Soudan, le Zimbabwe et le Venezuela qui torturent ou tuent des manifestants, affirmant qu'en France aucun mort n'est à déplorer. Michelle Bachelet invite le Gouvernement français à dialoguer avec les manifestants, et rappelle que « même dans des États prospères, des gens se sentent exclus des bénéfices du développement et privés de droits économiques et sociaux »[412],[413].

Le président Macron a plusieurs contacts avec le pape François : une première fois lors d'une audience le 26 juin 2018 au Vatican[414] ; une deuxième fois par téléphone, le 16 avril 2019 , à la suite de l'incendie de Notre-Dame de Paris[415] ; une troisième fois par téléphone le 21 avril 2020 , dans le contexte de la pandémie de Covid-19[416].

Coprince français d'Andorre

Emmanuel Macron en 2019.

En tant que président de la République française, Emmanuel Macron est coprince d'Andorre aux côtés de l'évêque d'Urgell. Au moment de son élection, il reçoit la citoyenneté ainsi qu'un passeport andorrans[417],[418]. En juillet 2017, il rencontre à Paris le chef du gouvernement, Antoni Martí, et le président du Parlement, Vicenç Mateu. Les trois hommes discutent des réformes économiques et sociales de la principauté, dont l'introduction récente d'une nouvelle législation fiscale. Emmanuel Macron promet de soutenir l'Andorre dans ses négociations pour l'obtention d'un statut d'association avec l'Union européenne[419],[420].

En septembre 2019, il effectue une visite officielle dans les sept paroisses de la principauté, suivant la « règle non écrite » qui veut que les présidents français se rendent toujours une fois en Andorre au cours de leur mandat[421],[417]. Il est le premier président français à avoir un portrait officiel spécifique à sa fonction de coprince[422].

Pendant la pandémie de Covid-19, le gouvernement andorran sollicite auprès de lui une aide économique, mais Emmanuel Macron oppose une fin de non-recevoir à cette demande, estimant que « la France est plongée elle aussi dans une situation économique fort délicate et que, par ailleurs, la Banque de France ne saurait octroyer un crédit à un pays tiers sans l’aval de la Banque centrale européenne »[423].

Élection présidentielle de 2022

Durant sa présidence, les sondages le donnent quasi-systématiquement en tête du premier tour et réélu au second mais avec une avance plus faible qu’en 2017[424].

Selon les médias, il prépare sa candidature à un second mandat à partir du début de l'année 2021[425],[426]. Alors qu’il défend son bilan dans des allocutions télévisées consacrées à la pandémie de Covid-19 et formule des promesses de réformes, l’opposition demande le décompte de son temps de parole en vue de l’élection présidentielle à venir[427]. Le contexte électoral est marqué par un débat grandissant sur la concentration des médias, qui lui serait favorable[428],[429],[430]. En outre, la campagne intervient en pleine présidence française du Conseil de l'Union européenne[431],[432].

Dans un entretien au Parisien en janvier 2022, il dit avoir « envie » d'être candidat[433]. Son entourage fait savoir qu'il ne participera pas aux débats organisés entre les candidats au premier tour de l’élection[434]. Le 3 mars 2022 , Emmanuel Macron annonce dans une Lettre aux Français sa candidature à un second mandat de président de la République, à la veille de la clôture des candidatures par le Conseil constitutionnel où il rassemble 2 098 parrainages d'élus . Le slogan de sa campagne est « Avec vous », selon le site préfigurant sa candidature lancé discrètement le 27 janvier 2022 [435].

La Commission nationale de contrôle de la campagne électorale en vue de l’élection présidentielle lui reproche d’utiliser son compte officiel de chef de l’État sur Twitter pour faire campagne[436]. Le 7 mars, il confirme également son refus de participer à un débat avant le premier tour lors de son premier déplacement à Poissy[437]. Selon Libération, le président craint notamment une confrontation directe avec Philippe Poutou, ne voulant pas être pris pour cible par le candidat trotskiste comme François Fillon l'avait été lors du précédent scrutin[438],[439],[440].

Au soir du 10 avril 2022 , il arrive en tête du premier tour avec 27,85 % soit une progression de 3,8 % par rapport à 2017. Il devance une nouvelle fois la candidate du RN Marine Le Pen (23,15 %). Il bénéficie d'un appel au report de voix d'une partie des candidats de gauche (Yannick Jadot, Fabien Roussel et Anne Hidalgo) face à sa concurrente soutenue par la droite souverainiste (Éric Zemmour, Nicolas Dupont-Aignan).

Le débat d'entre-deux-tours opposant Emmanuel Macron et Marine Le Pen a lieu le mercredi 20 avril 2022 sur TF1, France 2, BFM TV, France Info, LCI et CNews, dans des conditions très proches de celles du débat d'entre-deux-tours de 2017[441]. Auparavant, le président par intérim du Rassemblement national Jordan Bardella, avait déjà débattu des principaux sujets de l'entre-deux-tours avec le ministre de l'Intérieur Gérald Darmanin sur BFM TV le 13 avril et avec le ministre de la Santé Olivier Véran sur LCI le 18 avril[442]

Le 24 avril 2022 , au soir du second tour de l’élection présidentielle, Emmanuel Macron est réélu président de la République face à Marine Le Pen, avec un score annoncé de 58% des voix[443]. Il reçoit les félicitations de chefs de gouvernement étrangers, tels que Boris Johnson, Olaf Scholz, et de la présidente de la Commission européenne, Ursula von der Leyen[444]. Le Conseil constitutionnel proclame un résultat de 58,55 %, soit 18 768 639 voix, contre 41,45 % et 13 288 686 voix pour Marine Le Pen[445]. Emmanuel Macron est ainsi le premier président de la Ve République à être réélu depuis l'instauration de l'élection présidentielle au suffrage universel, hors période de cohabitation[446],[o].

Second mandat (depuis 2022)

Cérémonie d'investiture

La deuxième cérémonie d'investiture d'Emmanuel Macron a lieu le samedi 7 mai 2022 au palais de l'Élysée, en présence du gouvernement et de nombreux invités. Son second mandat débute officiellement le 14 mai suivant, à 0 heure[447].

Il reçoit la démission du premier ministre Jean Castex et nomme Élisabeth Borne comme nouveau chef du gouvernement, qui devient la deuxième femme à occuper ce poste après Édith Cresson.

Échec à reconduire une majorité absolue à l'Assemblée nationale

Les élections législatives qui suivent son élection voient l'opposition de gauche s'unir au sein de la Nouvelle Union populaire écologique et sociale avec l'objectif de pousser Emmanuel Macron à une cohabitation avec Jean-Luc Mélenchon[448]. Lors du premier tour du scrutin, la NUPES fait jeu égal avec la majorité du président regroupée dans la coalition Ensemble[449], avec un score d'environ 26%. Le Rassemblement national obtient de son côté son meilleur score à un scrutin législatif avec 18,68% des suffrages[450].

Les projections en sièges des sondages de l'entre-deux tours laissent entrevoir la possibilité qu'Emmanuel Macron puisse perdre sa majorité. Le président et les membres de sa coalition concentrent dès lors toutes leurs attaques sur la NUPES et son programme de gouvernement[451],[452]. Emmanuel Macron rompt finalement avec le front républicain lors d'une prise de parole improvisée sur le tarmac d'Orly[453] au cours de laquelle il refuse de donner une consigne de vote dans les circonscriptions où le second tour oppose un candidat de la NUPES à un candidat RN, réclamant plutôt « une majorité solide » au nom de « l'intérêt supérieur de la nation »[454]. Cette déclaration est vivement critiquée par les membres de la NUPES qui appellent à faire barrage en sa faveur lors du scrutin présidentiel deux mois auparavant[455].

Aucune des deux coalitions ne parvient à obtenir la majorité absolue mais Emmanuel Macron dispose d'une majorité relative de députés[456], une situation similaire à celle de François Mitterrand lors de sa propre réélection. Toutefois, l'élection de 89 députés du Rassemblement national, dans un mode de scrutin historiquement défavorable à l'extrême droite, questionne certains observateurs sur sa responsabilité dans ce score historique en refusant clairement d'appeler à voter pour les candidats de la gauche face aux candidats nationalistes, alors qu'il affirmait que son premier mandat ne donnerait plus aucune raison de « voter pour les extrêmes »[457],[458],[459].

Difficultés de gouvernance

Après les élections législatives, Élisabeth Borne présente la démission de son gouvernement à Emmanuel Macron — démission traditionnelle à la suite d'un scrutin législatif — mais celui-ci la refuse « afin que le gouvernement puisse demeurer à la tâche », une première dans l'histoire de la Ve République[460]. Après avoir reçu les différents présidents de groupe de la nouvelle assemblée, le président se dit prêt à ouvrir le gouvernement aux partis d'oppositions, à l'exception du Rassemblement national mais aussi de La France insoumise, qu'il considère tous deux comme « ne s’[inscrivant] pas comme des partis de gouvernement »[461]. Cette proposition est rejetée par les différents partis.

Les débuts de la nouvelle législature sont houleux, la Première ministre refusant de solliciter la confiance des députés[462]. L'absence de majorité absolue du camp présidentiel combinée à l'absence de consensus avec les oppositions voit le gouvernement utiliser plus d'une vingtaine de fois le controversé article 49.3 de la Constitution pour valider ses projets de lois sans vote au Parlement[463]. Bien que des motions de censure soient à chaque fois déposées par la NUPES d'une part et le Rassemblement national d'autre part, le refus des Républicains de voter une quelconque motion permet au gouvernement de se maintenir[464].

Crise sociale et politique du début de 2023

La presse et les observateurs évoquent dès la mi-mars 2023 une « crise sociale et politique » liée à la longueur et la dureté du mouvement social contestant la réforme des retraites et la décision de déclencher pour la onzième fois en moins d'un an l'article 49.3 pour la faire adopter sans vote, ce qui est sans précédent pour une réforme des retraites[465],[466]. Emmanuel Macron refuse notamment de rencontrer les syndicats, qui demandent à être reçus par le président[467].

Pour tenter de « reprendre la main », il laisse sa Première ministre les recevoir début avril mais ceux-ci ne restent qu'une petite heure avec elle. Laurent Berger, le numéro un de la CFDT affirme alors que cette « crise sociale est en train de se transformer en crise démocratique ». L'entourage du président a immédiatement contesté cette vision des choses[468] et mis en avant le fait que ce projet de réforme des retraites avait, lors de l'élection présidentielle, été « porté, expliqué et assumé » par le président français. Les tensions sont telles que par mesure de sécurité et pour éviter les provocations, la visite en France du nouveau roi du Royaume-Uni Charles III, prévue fin mars est reportée, en concertation avec les autorités anglaises[469].

Le 14 avril 2023, le conseil constitutionnel déclare la réforme conforme à la Constitution. Dans les heures qui suivent, Emmanuel Macron promulgue la loi, qui est aussitôt inscrite au Journal officiel[470] et annonce sa seconde allocution télévisée en un mois, pendant laquelle des concerts de casseroles ont lieu dans de nombreuses villes de France[471],[472] puis au cours de ses déplacements officiels dans les semaines qui suivent[473],[474],[475],[476].

Émeutes et violences policières de l'été 2023

Le 27 juin 2023, Nahel Merzouk, un jeune franco-algérien de 17 ans est abattu à bout portant par un policier à Nanterre. La version policière, présentant cette mort comme consécutive à un refus d'obtempérer et l'usage de son arme par le policier comme un cas de légitime défense, est contredite dans les heures qui suivent par la diffusion de vidéos sur les réseaux sociaux et le témoignage des deux passagers. L'événement provoque de violentes émeutes dans les jours qui suivent, considérées comme dépassant en intensité celles de 2005[477]. Jugeant la mort de Nahel « inexplicable » et « inexcusable »[478], Emmanuel Macron évoque auprès des policiers mobilisés dans les émeutes l'idée de sanctionner financièrement les familles de délinquants « à la première connerie »[479] et de couper les réseaux sociaux lors des épisodes de violences urbaines voire de les obliger à supprimer tout contenu appelant à la révolte[480], proposition vivement critiquée par l'opposition[481].

Au cours des émeutes, de multiples signalements de violences policières ont lieu, pour lesquels la France est épinglée dans les jours qui suivent par l'ONU, le Conseil de l'Europe et Amnesty International[482]. L'un d'entre eux prend de l'ampleur au cours du mois de juillet, celui d'un jeune homme de 22 ans du nom de Hedi à Marseille, passé à tabac par des policiers et frôlant la mort. La mise en détention provisoire des policiers suspects provoque une fronde de certains de leurs collègues qui se mettent en arrêt maladie indus, réclamant un statut spécial en cas d'accusations pour des faits effectués dans le cadre de leurs missions[483]. Le directeur général de la police nationale Frédéric Veaux et le préfet de Paris Laurent Nuñez apportent leur soutien aux policiers suspectés, une position jugée comme violant le devoir de réserve[484] et que le monde judiciaire et l'opposition de gauche jugent « gravissime » voire d'atteinte à la séparation des pouvoirs[485],[486].

Lors d'une interview donnée à TF1 et France 2 le 24 juillet, le président dit vouloir « entendre l'émotion » des policiers et sans condamner les propos de Frédéric Veaux, rappelle que « nul en République n'est au-dessus de la loi »[487]. Les oppositions manifestent leur colère : les responsables LFI accusent le président « d'encourager les abus de la police » ; au contraire, les responsables LR et RN lui reprochent de ne pas soutenir les policiers[488].

Guerre entre Israël et le Hamas

Les attaques terroristes du Hamas du 7 octobre 2023 relancent les hostilités du conflit israélo-palestinien. Emmanuel Macron déclare le lendemain « [condamner] fermement les attaques des terroristes du Hamas qui frappent actuellement Israël » et « [exprimer sa] pleine solidarité avec les victimes, leurs familles et leurs proches ». Il propose la création d'une coalition internationale contre le Hamas lors de sa visite en Israël à la fin de mois d'octobre[489]. Selon une information parue dans Le Monde, Bernard-Henri Lévy aurait suggéré au président de la République « de bâtir une coalition anti-Hamas sur le même modèle que celle visant l’organisation État islamique »[490]. Lévy lui-même évoque cet épisode dans son livre Nuit blanche. Cette idée refroidit les relations diplomatiques avec les pays arabes de la région[491] et ne trouve pas d'écho sur la scène internationale[492].

Emmanuel Macron exhorte Israël à cesser les bombardements dans la bande de Gaza lors d'un entretien accordé à la BBC au mois de novembre, provoquant une vive réaction de l'état hébreu[493],[494] qui pousse Emmanuel Macron à clarifier ses propos[495]. Dans la même période, il ne participe pas à la « marche civique » contre l'antisémitisme, organisée par les présidents des deux chambres du Parlement Yaël Braun-Pivet et Gérard Larcher, qui se tient le 12 novembre 2023 à Paris[496], marche dont la présence du Rassemblement national suscite une polémique à gauche et dans le camp du président[497],[498].

Il réaffirme le 15 novembre la position française d'une solution à deux États avec « la sécurité pour Israël, et un État pour les Palestiniens »[499], alors que certains ambassadeurs du Moyen-Orient pointaient un virage pro-israélien de sa part, en rupture avec la position historique de la France[500],[501]. Ses prises de positions dans le conflit suscitent également des réserves avec les diplomates du Quai d'Orsay, exclus des décisions du président[502],[503],[504].

Tensions dans la majorité sur la loi immigration de 2023

En décembre 2023, après le vote à l'Assemblée nationale d'une motion de rejet par les oppositions de la version du projet de loi immigration présenté par le gouvernement Borne, Emmanuel Macron décide de légiférer en passant par une commission mixte paritaire, qui reprend la version durcie par le Sénat, afin de ne pas utiliser à nouveau l'article 49.3, ni renoncer au projet de loi. Il refuse dans le même temps la démission de Gérald Darmanin, que les médias jugent affaibli politiquement par ce revers[505],[506]. Le 19 décembre, le projet de loi issu de la commission mixte paritaire est adopté grâce aux voix des Républicains et du Rassemblement national[507],[508], provoquant l'embarras dans le camp présidentiel[507]. Marine Le Pen qualifie l'adoption du texte de « victoire idéologique » tandis que les membres de la NUPES parle d'un « naufrage » du gouvernement[509]. La presse étrangère voit cette adoption comme un échec du macronisme[510] et une absence de barrage à l'extrême droite[511] seulement quelques mois avant le prochain scrutin européen[512], où les partis nationalistes européens pourraient remporter un nombre important de sièges[513],[514].

La majorité sort divisée de la séquence parlementaire : certains députés comme Gilles Le Gendre et Sacha Houlié votent contre le texte présenté, malgré la promesse de la part d'Emmanuel Macron d'un portefeuille ministériel en échange d'un vote favorable pour le deuxième[515], tandis que cinq ministres du gouvernement menacent de démissionner en cas d'adoption du texte. Seul le ministre de la Santé Aurélien Rousseau tient parole après le vote. L'aile gauche de la majorité parle également de « renoncements aux valeurs du macronisme »[507]. Le président admet, comme certains ministres, que de nombreuses mesures votées sont contraires à la constitution, et saisit le Conseil constitutionnel [516],[517]. Il est alors accusé de se défausser[518], ce que le président du Conseil des Sages Laurent Fabius ne manque pas de lui faire remarquer lors de la présentation de ses vœux au début de l'année 2024, en affirmant qu'ils ne sont pas « une chambre d’appel des choix du Parlement »[519],[520].

Gouvernement Gabriel Attal et campagne des élections européennes de 2024

Emmanuel Macron commence l'année 2024 par la nomination de Gabriel Attal au poste de Premier ministre pour succéder à Élisabeth Borne[521], qui laisse entendre dans sa lettre de démission qu'il s'agit d'une demande du président lui-même[522]. Les ministres s'étant opposés à la loi immigration, à l'exception de Sylvie Retailleau, ne sont pas reconduits dans le nouveau gouvernement[523]. L'absence de la plupart des ministres issus de la gauche sous les gouvernements précédents et la nomination de plusieurs figures proches de Nicolas Sarkozy — comme Rachida Dati — sont commentées par les médias comme une « droitisation » de l'exécutif voire un retour du sarkozysme[524],[525],[526],[527], ainsi que la fin du « en même temps »[528],[529],[530],[531],[532]. Les débuts du gouvernement, dirigé par le plus jeune Premier ministre de la Ve République, sont émaillés par les polémiques de Amélie Oudéa-Castéra — nommée ministre de l'Éducation nationale, de la Jeunesse, des Sports, des Jeux olympiques et paralympiques — autour de ses propos sur l'école publique et son conflit d'intérêts vis-à-vis du collège Stanislas[533].

En vue des élections européennes de 2024, Emmanuel Macron est également confronté à une absence de figure majeure pour mener la liste de sa coalition pour le Parlement européen[534], la plupart de ses ministres refusant de se présenter au scrutin[535],[536]. Il choisit finalement la députée européenne Valérie Hayer, vue « un choix par défaut »[537],[538],[539]. Tout comme en 2019, il s'implique personnellement dans la campagne face aux intentions de votes en faveur du Rassemblement national de Jordan Bardella, qui demande une dissolution de l'Assemblée nationale en cas de victoire[540]. Lors de son deuxième discours de la Sorbonne en avril, le président tente de focaliser le débat sur la construction européenne, sans parvenir à intéresser l'opinion[540]. Dans les dernières semaines de campagne, la liste macroniste chute dans les intentions de vote au profit de la liste socialiste menée par Raphaël Glucksmann[541].

Le Rassemblement national finit largement en tête du scrutin avec 31,37%, un score plus de deux fois plus élevé que les 14,30% de la liste de Valérie Hayer qui manque de finir à la troisième place face à Raphaël Glucksmann, qui obtient 13,83% des suffrages[542],[543].

Dissolution de l'Assemblée nationale

Le 9 juin 2024 au soir, en réponse aux résultats des élections européennes, Emmanuel Macron annonce la dissolution de l'Assemblée nationale et convoque des élections législatives anticipées[544]. Interrogé sur son ressenti le lendemain lors des célébrations du 80e anniversaire du débarquement de Normandie de la Libération, il répond selon le journal Le Monde qu'il y réfléchissait « depuis des semaines, et [en est] ravi », estimant qu'il a « balancé [sa] grenade dégoupillée dans ses jambes [à l'opposition] » afin de voir comment elles réagissent[545].

Il motive la dissolution pour clarifier le paysage politique, afin de mettre en lumière les « incohérences » des deux blocs d'opposition — le clivage gauche-droite — tentés de nouer des « alliances contre nature » alors qu'il est l'auteur de la doctrine du « en même temps »[545],[546]. Son initiative suscite le désarroi dans la majorité, mais il affirme que la « dissolution instaure une dynamique [dont le] mouvement est dorénavant de [leur] côté »[547]. Espérant briser la gauche, il obtient l'inverse avec une large coalition du spectre des forces politiques sous le Nouveau Front populaire[545]. Quant à la droite, elle se recompose après la crise suivant la proposition d'alliance entre le parti conservateur Les Républicains et le parti d'extrême droite Rassemblement national[546]. Après les résultats du premier tour des élections législatives de 2024 qui voit une confirmation de l'affaiblissement du parti présidentiel et la « décomposition de sa majorité », Emmanuel Macron est largement critiqué par la presse pour avoir placé le pays dans l'alternative de voter pour le Rassemblement national ou de connaître un possible blocage institutionnel[548],[549].

Le second tour voit finalement émerger une majorité relative pour la coalition du Nouveau Front populaire, tandis que le camp présidentiel parvient à devenir la deuxième force de l'Assemblée grâce au front républicain de l'électorat de gauche[550],[551],[552]. Emmanuel Macron refuse néanmoins dans un premier temps la démission de Gabriel Attal au lendemain des législatives afin d'assurer la « stabilité du pays » le temps d'avoir « la structuration de la nouvelle Assemblée nationale »[553],[554], une démarche fortement contestée par les partis d'opposition[555]. La démission du gouvernement Attal est finalement acceptée le 16 juillet, sans qu'Emmanuel Macron ne nomme un successeur, maintenant les ministres dans un gouvernement de gestion des affaires courantes[556].

Période de gouvernement démissionnaire

Le 23 juillet, après deux semaines de tractations difficiles, le Nouveau Front populaire propose Lucie Castets comme Première ministre, une heure avant une interview prévue de Emmanuel Macron[557], au cours de laquelle il annonce son refus de nommer un nouveau locataire à Matignon dans l'immédiat, affirmant qu' « il est faux de dire que le Nouveau Front populaire aurait une majorité, quelle qu’elle soit » et que « la question n’est pas un nom. La question, c’est quelle majorité peut se dégager à l’Assemblée pour qu’un gouvernement de la France puisse passer des réformes, passer un budget et faire avancer le pays »[558],[559]. Il appelle les partis à s'entendre, en étant capables de « sortir […] de leurs évidences » et de « savoir faire des compromis ». Il écarte l'hypothèse d’une démission et demande une trêve politique en raison des Jeux olympiques qui débutent le 26 juillet[560].

Après la fin des Jeux olympiques, il appelle de nouveau les partis à « travailler ensemble », renvoyant les forces politiques à l'exemple qu'ont donné tous ceux qui ont participé au succès de l'organisation des Jeux[561]. Après avoir reçu les différents partis à l'Élysée, il déclare dans un communiqué publié le 26 août qu’il exclut, « au nom de la stabilité institutionnelle », d'appeler la gauche à former un gouvernement du Nouveau Front populaire autour de Lucie Castets[562],[563]. Le président ne souhaite également pas que la gauche abroge sa réforme des retraites et augmente le salaire minimum[564],[565]. Ce nouveau refus de nommer un nouveau Premier ministre plusieurs semaines après la défaite de son camp aux deux derniers scrutins nationaux est vu comme le début d'une crise politique inédite sous la Ve République[566],[567]. En conséquence, les insoumis menace de déclencher une procédure de destitution du président de la République, une démarche qui ne fait pas l'unanimité au sein de la coalition de gauche[568].

Continuant de consulter les différents mouvements politiques, les noms de Bernard Cazeneuve et de Xavier Bertrand circulent début septembre mais se heurtent au refus du Parti socialiste de soutenir inconditionnellement leur ancien Premier ministre pour le premier[569] et à la vive hostilité du Rassemblement national pour le second[570]. Simultanément, la procédure de destitution est déclenchée par les insoumis le 3 septembre[571],[572],[573]. Emmanuel Macron nomme finalement Michel Barnier le 5 septembre après plus d'une cinquantaine de jours avec un gouvernement démissionnaire[574],[575],[576], battant un record de 37 jours datant de 1957 sous la Quatrième République[577]. Plusieurs observateurs notent que dans cette configuration, le nouveau gouvernement est entièrement dépendant du Rassemblement national - désormais en situation d'arbitre - pour appliquer sa politique, parlant même d'« accord tacite » entre le président et Marine Le Pen[578],[579],[580],[581],[582]. La procédure de destitution des insoumis est par la suite rejetée par la commission des lois le 2 octobre[583].

Emmanuel Macron (born December 21, 1977, Amiens, France) is a French banker and politician who was elected president of France in 2017. Macron was the first person in the history of the Fifth Republic to win the presidency without the backing of either the Socialists or the Gaullists, and he was France’s youngest head of state since Napoleon I. He was reelected in 2022, becoming the first French president in two decades to win a second term.

Early life and start in politics Macron is the eldest of three siblings born to a family of doctors who held politically liberal views. He attended a private lycée (secondary school) in Amiens, where he proved to be an exceptionally gifted student. While there he began a long-term relationship with his drama teacher, Brigitte Trogneux, and the two were later married (2007). Macron completed his baccalauréat at the prestigious Lycée Henri-IV in Paris before studying international policy and public service at the grande école Sciences Po. During this time he also served as an editorial assistant for philosopher and historian Paul Ricoeur. In 2001 Macron received a master’s degree in public policy from Sciences Po as well as a master’s degree in philosophy from Paris Nanterre University. In 2004 he graduated near the top of his class from the prestigious École Nationale d’Administration (ENA), a school that had attained a reputation as a fast track to political power. The French presidents Valéry Giscard d’Estaing, Jacques Chirac, and François Hollande were all ENA alumni. Macron began his public service career in 2004 as a finance inspector for the French Ministry of Economy and Finance. Four years later he bought out his government contract for €50,000 (approximately $70,000) to enter the private sector, a move that friends warned would jeopardize any future political ambitions. In September 2008 he joined Rothschild & Cie Banque, the French division of the international Rothschild financial group, as an investment banker. Macron advanced quickly at the company, and in 2012 he brokered Nestlé’s blockbuster $12 billion acquisition of Pfizer’s baby food division. Macron reportedly earned €2.9 million (about $3.8 million) for his role in the deal. While still at Rothschild, Macron began working with Hollande as the latter campaigned for the Socialist Party’s nomination for president ahead of the 2012 election. After Hollande won the presidency, Macron joined his administration as a deputy chief of staff and an economic adviser. Macron became the face of France at international summits, and in 2014 he was elevated to finance minister. He promoted a package of reforms known as the loi Macron (“Macron law”) in an effort to spark the moribund French economy, but the legislation triggered a revolt from the left wing of the Socialist Party. In February 2015 Prime Minister Manuel Valls was forced to invoke Article 49 of the French constitution, a rarely used measure that allows a bill to pass without the consent of parliament on the condition that the government is then subjected to a vote of confidence. Valls easily survived that vote, and the loi Macron was enacted. As a result, restrictions on conducting business on Sundays were loosened and some professions were deregulated, but the labor market was largely untouched, and France’s 35-hour workweek remained intact. The loi Macron amounted to a relatively modest reform package for a country grappling with persistently high unemployment and slow growth, but it nevertheless sparked a fierce backlash from both the left and the right.

Rise to the presidency Hollande’s approval rating plummeted as a result of France’s anemic economic performance and Europe’s ongoing migrant crisis; both of these factors would fuel the rise of Marine Le Pen and her nationalist anti-immigrant party, the National Front (now National Rally). Macron began to distance himself from Hollande, even while still serving in his administration, but deadly terrorist attacks in Paris in November 2015 caused him to delay his break with the Socialist government. In April 2016 Macron announced the creation of En Marche! (“Forward!”), a popular movement that he characterized as a “democratic revolution” against a sclerotic political system. Echoing the third-way paradigm that had been promoted by Pres. Bill Clinton in the United States and Prime Minister Tony Blair in Britain, Macron proposed a center-left fusion of populism and neoliberalism. Observers noted that the timing of the announcement—slightly more than a year ahead of the 2017 presidential election—strongly hinted at an outsider bid for the Élysée Palace. Macron’s relationship with Hollande became increasingly strained following the launch of En Marche!, but this was hardly a liability given the president’s single-digit public approval numbers. On August 30, 2016, Macron submitted his resignation, and on November 16 he formally declared his candidacy for president. The campaign took a turn in Macron’s favor later that month, when the Republicans elected former prime minister François Fillon as their party’s nominee. Fillon topped former president Nicolas Sarkozy and former prime minister Alain Juppé in the intraparty contest. Fillon had been marked as the likely front-runner in the presidential race, but his campaign imploded amid accusations that he had created fake jobs for members of his family and had improperly accepted tens of thousands of euros in gifts. Hollande, perceiving no realistic path to a second term, announced in December 2016 that he would not seek reelection. Valls resigned as prime minister and declared his candidacy, but the Socialists selected Benoît Hamon, a political outsider from the party’s far left wing, as their nominee. Valls and Juppé, representing their parties’ moderate factions, subsequently declared their support for Macron, a significant coup for a candidate who did not have major party backing. Historically low support for France’s two major parties opened the door for independent candidates, and the race effectively became a three-way contest between Macron, Le Pen, and Jean-Luc Mélenchon, a former Socialist who had run for president in 2012 with the support of the French Communist Party. While Le Pen drew from the far right and Mélenchon from the far left, Macron’s centrist antiestablishment message found support from a broad cross section of the populace. Notably, Macron was also the only prominent pro-European Union candidate in a race that carried a strong undercurrent of Euroskepticism.

Subscribe When French voters went to the polls for the first round of the presidential election on April 23, 2017, Macron topped a field of 11 candidates, capturing 24 percent of the vote. Le Pen was second with 21 percent, guaranteeing her a spot in the second round to be held two weeks later. Fillon and Mélenchon finished in a virtual dead heat for third, each claiming about 20 percent, while Hamon was a distant fifth with just over 6 percent. For the first time in the history of the Fifth Republic, neither of France’s two main parties were represented in the runoff. Just days before that event, hackers uploaded tens of thousands of internal Macron campaign communications to the Internet in an apparent attempt to influence the election. The attack was attributed to the same Russian-backed group that targeted the Democratic Party during the 2016 U.S. presidential election, but the effect of the so-called “MacronLeaks” information dump was negligible, owing at least in part to French media laws banning campaign coverage in the hours prior to an election. In the second round, held on May 7, 2017, Macron won a convincing two-thirds of the vote, becoming, at age 39, France’s youngest president. Voters still found ways to voice their dissatisfaction with both Macron and Le Pen, however. Roughly one-fourth of French voters abstained entirely—the highest rate of electorate nonparticipation in nearly a half century—while more than four million voters cast intentionally blank or spoiled ballots. Macron’s victory was welcomed outside of France; indeed, the euro soared to a six-month high upon the news. With no existing party structure, Macron’s first challenge as president would be to secure a working majority in the French parliament.

(more) When legislative elections were held in June, En Marche! delivered a convincing victory, winning 308 of 577 seats in the National Assembly. With additional support from François Bayrou’s Democratic Movement (MoDem), Macron’s coalition commanded a total of 350 seats. Although the result marked a stunning performance for a party that was just 14 months old, turnout was just 42.6 percent, the lowest rate of voter participation in a parliamentary election in modern French history. Macron quickly became a presence on the world stage: as Britain struggled to complete the Brexit process and Germany’s Angela Merkel began inching toward retirement, the charismatic young president of France found room to assert himself. Macron’s growing influence abroad did little to bolster his domestic approval, however. A tax plan that benefited France’s wealthiest citizens earned him the nickname président des riches (“president of the rich”), and criticism of Macron sharply intensified in November 2018, when France was rocked by a wave of demonstrations in opposition to a proposed fuel tax increase. The protesters, dubbed gilets jaunes (“yellow vests”) after the bright traffic safety vests they wore, had broad support among the French public, and Macron was forced to withdraw the fuel tax. Macron experienced a brief surge in popularity in April 2019, when a fire seriously damaged Notre-Dame Cathedral and he launched a fundraising campaign that brought in hundreds of millions of dollars for the repair and rebuilding of the iconic Paris landmark. Macron’s agenda had included curbs on government spending—he famously quipped that there was no “magic money” to spend on services without a corresponding increase in government revenues—but he was forced to put aside these measures when his administration was faced with the greatest global public health challenge in a century. The coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 pandemic caused a sharp economic contraction as France locked down nonessential businesses and restricted travel, but the country recovered relatively quickly. Although more than 25 million people in France contracted COVID-19, the potentially deadly disease caused by the virus, the country’s high rate of vaccination and its robust jobs retention scheme spared France from the high death rates and lingering unemployment that were evident elsewhere."

Angela Dorothea Merkel (German: [aŋˈɡeːla doʁoˈteːa ˈmɛʁkl̩] ⓘ;[a] née Kasner; born 17 July 1954) is a German retired politician who served as Chancellor of Germany from 2005 to 2021. She is the only woman to have held the office. Merkel previously served as Leader of the Opposition from 2002 to 2005 and as Leader of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) from 2000 to 2018.[9] During her chancellorship, Merkel was frequently referred to as the de facto leader of the European Union (EU) and the most powerful woman in the world.

Merkel was born in Hamburg in West Germany. Her family moved to East Germany when she was an infant. Merkel obtained a doctorate in quantum chemistry in 1986 and worked as a research scientist until 1989.[10] She then entered politics in the wake of the Revolutions of 1989, briefly serving as deputy spokeswoman for the first democratically elected government of East Germany led by Lothar de Maizière. Following German reunification in 1990, Merkel was elected to the Bundestag for the state of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern. As the protégée of chancellor Helmut Kohl, Merkel was appointed as Minister for Women and Youth in 1991, later becoming Minister for the Environment, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety in 1994. After the CDU lost the 1998 federal election, Merkel was elected general secretary of the party. She then became the party's first female leader, and the first female leader of the Opposition, two years later.

Following the 2005 federal election, Merkel was elected chancellor, leading a grand coalition consisting of the CDU, the Christian Social Union (CSU), and the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD). She was the first woman to be elected chancellor, and the first chancellor of reunified Germany to have been raised in the former East Germany.[b] In the 2009 federal election, the CDU obtained the largest share of the vote, and Merkel subsequently formed a coalition government with the Free Democratic Party (FDP), an alliance more favourable to the CDU than the grand coalition.[12] In the 2013 federal election, the CDU won a landslide victory and formed a second grand coalition with the SPD, after the FDP lost all of its representation in the Bundestag.[13] In the 2017 federal election, Merkel led the CDU to become the largest party for the fourth time, resulting in the formation of a third grand coalition with the SPD.[14]

In foreign policy, Merkel emphasised international cooperation, both in the context of the EU and NATO, and initiating the Russian reset and strengthening of Eurasian and transatlantic economic relations. In the first half of 2007, Merkel served as president of the European Council and played a central role in the negotiation of the Treaty of Lisbon and the Berlin Declaration. Merkel's governments managed the global 2007–2008 financial crisis and the European debt crisis. She negotiated the 2008 European Union stimulus plan, which focused on infrastructure spending and public investment to counteract the Great Recession. In domestic policy, Merkel's Energiewende programme supported the development of renewable energy sources and eventually phased out the use of nuclear power in Germany. Despite the 2014 Russian annexation of Crimea, which prompted sanctions around the world, she initiated the construction of the controversial Nord Stream 2 pipelines to Russia and protected their construction from United States sanctions imposed in 2019. Reforms to the Bundeswehr, health care reform, the 2010s European migrant crisis, and the COVID-19 pandemic were major issues during her chancellorship. Merkel stepped down as leader of the CDU in 2018 and did not seek a fifth term as chancellor in the 2021 federal election. Following the Russian invasion of Ukraine, her legacy came under increased scrutiny both in Germany and abroad for her relatively good relations with Russia and increasing the German economy's dependence on Russia, as well as the downsizing of the military that occurred during her tenure.[15][16]

Background and early life

Merkel's paternal grandparents when engaged: Margarethe and her betrothed, Ludwik Marian Kaźmierczak, in his Polish Blue Army uniform

Merkel was born Angela Dorothea Kasner in 1954, in Hamburg, West Germany, the daughter of Horst Kasner (1926–2011; né Kaźmierczak),[17][18] a Lutheran pastor and a native of Berlin, and his wife Herlind (1928–2019; née Jentzsch), born in Danzig (now Gdańsk, Poland), a teacher of English and Latin. She has two younger siblings, Marcus Kasner, a physicist, and Irene Kasner, an occupational therapist. In her childhood and youth, Merkel was known among her peers by the nickname ""Kasi"", derived from her last name Kasner.[19][page needed][20]

Merkel is of German and Polish descent. Her paternal grandfather, Ludwik Kasner, was a German policeman of Polish ethnicity. After being captured in France during World War I, he joined the Blue Army and likely fought against Germany.[21][22] He married Merkel's grandmother Margarethe, a German from Berlin, and relocated to her hometown where he again worked in the police. In 1930, they Germanised the Polish name Kaźmierczak to Kasner.[23][24][25][26] Merkel's maternal grandparents were the Danzig politician Willi Jentzsch and Gertrud Alma (née Drange), a daughter of the city clerk of Elbing (now Elbląg, Poland) Emil Drange. Since the mid-1990s, Merkel has publicly mentioned her Polish heritage on several occasions and described herself as a quarter Polish, but her Polish roots became better known as a result of a 2013 biography.[27]

Religion played a key role in the Kasner family's migration from West Germany to East Germany.[28] Merkel's paternal grandfather was originally Catholic but the entire family converted to Lutheranism during the childhood of her father,[24] who later studied Lutheran theology in Heidelberg and Hamburg. In 1954, when Angela was just three months old, her father received a pastorate at the church in Quitzow [de] (a district of Perleberg in Brandenburg), which was then in East Germany.[29] The family moved to Templin and Merkel grew up in the countryside 90 km (56 mi) north of East Berlin.[29]

In 1968, Merkel joined the Free German Youth (FDJ), the official communist youth movement sponsored by the ruling Marxist–Leninist Socialist Unity Party of Germany.[30][31] Membership was nominally voluntary, but those who did not join found it difficult to gain admission to higher education.[32] She did not participate in the secular coming-of-age ceremony Jugendweihe, however, which was common in East Germany. Instead, she was confirmed.[33] During this time, she participated in several compulsory courses on Marxism–Leninism, with her grades only being regarded as ""sufficient"".[34] Merkel later said that ""Life in the GDR was sometimes almost comfortable in a certain way, because there were some things one simply couldn't influence.""[35] Merkel learned to speak Russian fluently at school, and she was awarded prizes for her proficiency in Russian and mathematics, being at the top of her class in these subjects. She completed her school education with the best possible average Abitur grade of 1.0.[36]

Academic career

Merkel continued her education at Karl Marx University, Leipzig, where she studied physics from 1973 to 1978.[29] While a student, she participated in the reconstruction of the ruin of the Moritzbastei, a project students initiated to create their own club and recreation facility on campus. Such an initiative was unprecedented in the GDR of that period, and initially resisted by the university. With backing of the local leadership of the SED party, the project was allowed to proceed.[37]

Near the end of her studies, Merkel sought an assistant professorship at an engineering school. As a condition for getting the job, Merkel was told she would need to agree to report on her colleagues to officers of the Stasi. Merkel declined, using the excuse that she could not keep secrets well enough to be an effective spy.[38]

Merkel worked and studied at the Central Institute for Physical Chemistry of the Academy of Sciences in Berlin-Adlershof from 1978 to 1990. At first, she and her husband squatted in Mitte.[39] At the Academy of Sciences, she became a member of its FDJ secretariat. According to her former colleagues, she openly propagated Marxism as the secretary for ""Agitation and Propaganda"".[40] However, Merkel has denied this claim and stated that she was secretary for culture, which involved activities like obtaining theatre tickets and organising talks by visiting Soviet authors.[41] She stated: ""I can only rely on my memory, if something turns out to be different, I can live with that.""[40]

After being awarded a doctorate (Dr. rer. nat.) for her thesis on quantum chemistry in 1986,[42] she worked as a researcher and published several academic papers.[43][44] In 1986, she was allowed to travel to West Germany to attend a congress. She also participated in a multi-week language[which?] course in Donetsk, in the then-Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic.[45]

Early political career

1989–1990: German reunification

The fall of the Berlin Wall in November 1989 served as the catalyst for Merkel's political career.[46] Although she did not participate in the crowd celebrations the night the wall came down, one month later Merkel became involved in the growing democracy movement, joining the new party Democratic Beginning (Demokratischer Aufbruch, abbreviated to DA).[46] Party Leader Wolfgang Schnur appointed her as press spokeswoman of the party in February 1990. However, Schnur was revealed to have served as an ""informal co-worker"" for the Stasi just a few weeks ahead of the first (and only) multi-party election in 1990 and was later expelled from the party. As a result, the DA lost most of its electoral support, only managing to obtain four seats in the Volkskammer. However, because the DA was a member party of the Alliance for Germany, which won the election in a landslide, the DA was included in the government coalition. Merkel was appointed deputy spokesperson of this last pre-unification government under Lothar de Maizière.[47]

De Maizière was impressed with the way Merkel handled journalists investigating Schnur's role in the Stasi.[38][46] In April 1990, the DA merged with the East German Christian Democratic Union, which in turn merged with its western counterpart after reunification.[48][49]

1990–1994: Minister for Women and Youth

Elections

In the German federal election of 1990, the first to be held following reunification, Merkel successfully stood for election to the Bundestag in the parliamentary constituency of Stralsund – Nordvorpommern – Rügen in North Mecklenburg-Vorpommern.[50] She received the crucial backing of influential CDU minister and state party chairman Günther Krause. She was re-elected from this constituency (renamed, with slightly adjusted borders, Vorpommern-Rügen – Vorpommern-Greifswald I in 2003) in every election until the CDU lost its direct mandate from the constituency in the 2021 federal election.[51] Almost immediately following her entry into parliament, Merkel was appointed by Chancellor Helmut Kohl to serve as Minister for Women and Youth in the federal cabinet.

In November 1991, Merkel, with the support of the federal CDU, ran for the state leadership of the CDU in the state of Brandenburg, which neighbours Berlin. She lost to Ulf Fink.[52] In June 1993, Merkel was elected leader of the CDU in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, succeeding her former mentor Günther Krause.[53]

Policy

Although Merkel had little interest in the political position as such, it has been described as instrumental in building her early political image.[54][55] During her tenure, the government codified the right to preschool education, although the law only went into effect in 1996.[56] In June 1992, § 218 of the StGB, which governed abortion rights, was rewritten to allow abortions until the 12th week of pregnancy.[57] Though she was personally opposed to abortion at the time, Merkel abstained during the vote on the bill.[58] The law was later overturned by the Federal Constitutional Court on the basis that there must be a general prohibition of abortion.[57][59]

1994–1998: Minister for the Environment

In 1994, she was promoted to the position of Minister for the Environment and Nuclear Safety, which gave her greater political visibility and a platform on which to build her personal political career. As one of Kohl's protégées and his youngest Cabinet Minister, she was frequently referred to by Kohl as ""my girl"" (mein Mädchen).[60] During this period, she was closely mentored by Kohl.[55]

As Minister of the Environment, Merkel was instrumental in setting up the United Nations 1995 Berlin Climate Change Conference. She is often credited as having brought about its most notable result, the first international commitment to a reduction of greenhouse gas emissions.[61][54][62] Around this time, she also first hired Beate Baumann, who would remain a close advisor to Merkel.[55] Merkel's performance as Minister of the Environment was criticised as ""pitiful"" by Gerhard Schröder.[54]

1998–2000: General Secretary of the CDU

1998 CDU campaign poster depicting Merkel between Wolfgang Schäuble and Matthias Wissmann

After the Kohl Government was defeated at the 1998 election, Merkel was appointed Secretary-General of the CDU.[55] The 1998 election had widespread impacts; it was the CDU's worst performance in a federal election since 1949, and it resulted in Germany's first post-war left-wing government,[c] led by the SPD.[63]

In the wake of this defeat on the federal level, Merkel oversaw a string of CDU election victories in six out of seven state elections in 1999, breaking the long-standing SPD-Green hold on the Bundesrat. Following a party funding scandal that compromised many leading figures of the CDU – including Kohl himself and his successor as CDU Leader, Wolfgang Schäuble – Merkel criticised her former mentor publicly and advocated a fresh start for the party without him.[55]

Early 2000s

Chairperson of the CDU

On 10 April 2000, Merkel was elected to replace Schäuble as Chairperson of the CDU, becoming the first female leader of a German party.[64] Her election surprised many observers, as her personality offered a contrast to the party she had been elected to lead; Merkel is a centrist Protestant originating from predominantly Protestant northern Germany, while the CDU is a male-dominated, socially conservative party with strongholds in western and southern Germany, and its Bavarian sister party, the CSU, has deep Catholic roots.[65]

Merkel and Russian president Vladimir Putin in Moscow, 8 February 2002

Following Merkel's election as CDU Leader, the CDU did not obtain electoral victories in subsequent state elections. In February 2001, her rival Friedrich Merz voiced his intention to become Gerhard Schröder's main challenger for Chancellorship in the 2002 election. Merkel's own ambition to become Chancellor was well-known, but she lacked the support of the most influential members within her own party. Rival candidate and leader of the CSU Edmund Stoiber was much more popular within the party at the time. In a private negotiation that came to be known as the Wolfratshausen Breakfast, [de ] Merkel agreed to cede the opportunity to challenge Schröder to Stoiber; in exchange, she was to become leader of the CDU/CSU faction in the Bundestag following the election.[66][67][68] Although pre-election polling had indicated that voters strongly favoured Stoiber, he went on to lose the election by a thin margin. The election campaign was dominated by the Iraq War. While Chancellor Schröder had made clear he would not join the war in Iraq,[69] Merkel was in support of the war at the time, although she later claimed that she had opposed it.[70][71]

2002–2005: Leader of the Opposition

After Stoiber's defeat in 2002, in addition to her role as CDU Leader, Merkel became Leader of the Opposition in the Bundestag, as had been agreed upon between her and Stoiber. Friedrich Merz, who had held the post prior to the 2002 election, was eased out to make way for Merkel.[72]

Merkel supported a substantial reform agenda for Germany's economic and social system and was considered more pro-market than her own party (the CDU). She advocated German labour law changes, specifically removing barriers to laying off employees and increasing the allowed number of work hours in a week. She argued that existing laws made the country less competitive, because companies could not easily control labour costs when business was slow.[73]

Merkel argued that Germany should phase out nuclear power less quickly than the Schröder administration had planned.[74][75]

Merkel advocated a strong transatlantic partnership and German-American friendship. In the spring of 2003, defying strong public opposition, Merkel came out in favour of the 2003 invasion of Iraq, describing it as ""unavoidable"".[70] She also criticised the government's support for the accession of Turkey to the European Union, instead arguing in favour of a ""privileged partnership"".[76]

2005–2021: Chancellor of Germany

2005–2009: First CDU–SPD grand coalition

Election

On 30 May 2005, Merkel won the CDU/CSU nomination to challenge Chancellor Gerhard Schröder of the SPD in the 2005 federal elections. Her party began the campaign with a 21–point lead over the SPD in national opinion polls, although her personal popularity lagged behind that of the incumbent. However, the CDU/CSU campaign suffered[77] when Merkel, having made economic competence central to the CDU's platform, confused gross and net income twice during a televised debate.[78] She regained some momentum after she announced that she would appoint Paul Kirchhof, a former judge at the German Constitutional Court and leading fiscal policy expert, as Minister of Finance.[77]

Merkel and the CDU lost ground after Kirchhof proposed the introduction of a flat tax in Germany, again undermining the party's broad appeal on economic affairs.[79] This was compounded by Merkel's proposal to increase VAT[80] to reduce Germany's deficit and fill the gap in revenue from a flat tax. The SPD were able to increase their support simply by pledging not to introduce flat taxes or increase VAT.[77] Although Merkel's standing recovered after she distanced herself from Kirchhof's proposals, she remained considerably less popular than Schröder, who had been perceived as the more generally competent and trustworthy candidate.[81] The CDU's lead was down to 9 percentage points on the eve of the election, with Merkel having a significant lead in popularity based on opinion polls.[82][83] On 18 September 2005, Merkel's CDU/CSU and Schröder's SPD went head-to-head in the national elections, with the CDU/CSU winning 35.2% (CDU 27.8% / CSU 7.5%)[81] of the second votes[d] to the SPD's 34.2%.[83] The result was so close that both Schröder and Merkel initially claimed victory.[55][83] Neither the SPD–Green coalition nor the CDU/CSU and its preferred coalition partners, the Free Democratic Party, held enough seats to form a majority in the Bundestag.[83] A grand coalition between the CDU/CSU and SPD would face the challenge of both parties demanding the chancellorship.[83][84] However, after three weeks of negotiations, the two parties reached a deal for a grand coalition whereby Merkel would become Chancellor and the SPD would hold 8 of the 16 seats in the cabinet.[84] The deal was approved by both parties at party conferences on 14 November 2005.[85]

Merkel was elected Chancellor by the majority of delegates (397 to 217) in the newly assembled Bundestag on 22 November 2005, but 51 members of the governing coalition voted against her.[86] Reports at the time indicated that the grand coalition would pursue a mix of policies, some of which differed from Merkel's political platform as leader of the opposition and candidate for Chancellor. The coalition's intent was to cut public spending whilst increasing VAT (from 16 to 19%), social insurance contributions and the top rate of income tax.[87]

When announcing the coalition agreement, Merkel stated that the main aim of her government would be to reduce unemployment, and that it was this issue on which her government would be judged.[88]

Healthcare reform

Reform of the German healthcare system was a salient issue during the 2005 election; the previous system had been criticised as inefficient and overly bureaucratic.[89] After a significant period of negotiations, a deal was passed in 2006. While this agreement was described as having ""saved the coalition government"", it was also widely criticised as ineffectual. The deal also increased the tax burden on employers and their publicly insured employees.[90][91] The 2006 round of reforms introduced the ""health insurance duty"", which establishes that individuals must be insured either through the public insurance system or through private insurance firms and accordingly cannot be uninsured.[92] The reforms also targeted preventive healthcare as a priority, particularly with regards to eldercare.[92]

Eurozone crisis

On 4 October 2008, following the Irish Government's decision to guarantee all deposits in private savings accounts, a move she had strongly criticised,[93] Merkel said there were no plans for the German Government to do the same. The following day, Merkel stated that the government would guarantee private savings account deposits, after all.[94] However, two days later, on 6 October 2008, it emerged that the pledge was simply a political move that would not be backed by legislation.[95] Most other European governments eventually either raised the limits or promised to guarantee savings in full.[95]

The German government stepped in to assist the mortgage company Hypo Real Estate with a bailout. The deal was agreed upon on 6 October, with German banks contributing €30 billion and the Bundesbank €20 billion to an emergency credit line.[96]

At the time of the Greek government-debt crisis, Germany was the largest creditor of the Greek government, giving it significant negotiating power.[97] Merkel is often credited as having ""saved the Euro"", primarily due to her coordinating role in the development of debt relief policy.[97][98][99] The austerity measures imposed on debtors such as Greece, which were a significant part of Merkel's position in the negotiations, have been criticised as overly harsh by some observers.[100][98] Critics also highlighted Germany's own debt management issues.[101] A Bloomberg opinion piece noted that ""irresponsible borrowers can't exist without irresponsible lenders""; accordingly, ""Germany's banks were Greece's enablers.""[102]

In the course of the financial crisis, the Merkel cabinet increased the budget of the Kurzarbeit programme significantly and extended the permitted duration of such contracts from 6 months to 18 months.[103] Although similar provisions had existed previously, the Merkel cabinet's expansion of the programme was widely praised and is credited with having saved 500,000 jobs during the financial crisis.[104][105][106]

2009–2013: CDU–FDP coalition

Merkel's CDU was re-elected in 2009 with an increased number of seats and could form a governing coalition with the FDP. After brief negotiations, the second Merkel cabinet was sworn in on 28 October 2009.[107] In early 2011, Merkel's approval ratings plummeted, resulting in heavy losses in state elections for her party.[108] An August 2011 poll found her coalition had only 36% support compared to a rival potential coalition's 51%.[109] Notwithstanding the continuing effects of the 2008–2009 financial crisis, unemployment sank below the mark of 3 million unemployed people in 2011.[110]

Abolition of conscription

Following increased debate on the subject in the summer of 2010,[111] the German government announced plans to abolish conscription in Germany, making the Bundeswehr a volunteer military, in November 2010.[112] The decision was finalised in December that year,[113] and conscription was suspended on 1 July 2011.[114] Although somewhat popular at the time, the decision has later come under scrutiny, particularly following to the Russian invasion of Ukraine.[115][116] It has also been criticised in conjunction with Germany's financial commitments to NATO.[117] In 2023, 61% of Germans said that they were in favour of reestablishing conscription.[118]

Healthcare reform

Responding to a budget deficit of €11 billion in the public healthcare system in 2009, the Merkel government passed widely unpopular healthcare reforms in 2010. The changes reduced healthcare spending in certain areas and increased employer and employee contributions to 15.5% of gross wages.[119][120][121] The reforms also established that future contribution increases would only affect the contributions by employers, which was criticised by opposition parties and trade unions.[119]

2013–2017: Second CDU–SPD grand coalition

In the election of September 2013, Merkel won one of the most decisive victories in German history, achieving the best result for the CDU/CSU since reunification and coming within five seats of the first absolute majority in the Bundestag since 1957.[122] However, their preferred coalition partner, the FDP, failed to enter parliament for the first time since 1949, being below the minimum of 5% of second votes required to enter parliament.[13][123]

The CDU/CSU turned to the SPD to form the third grand coalition in postwar German history and the second under Merkel's leadership. The third Cabinet of Angela Merkel was sworn in on 17 December 2013.[124]

Merkel scored well in opinion polls on her handling of the recent euro crisis (69% rated her performance as good rather than poor), and her approval rating reached an all-time high of 77% in February 2012 and again in July 2014.[125]

2015 European migrant crisis

Throughout the course of the European migrant crisis, Merkel encouraged cooperation between EU member states, urging that Europe needs to act ""as a whole"".[126]

In late August 2015, at the height of the crisis, Merkel's government suspended the Dublin Regulation, which stipulated that asylum seekers must seek asylum in the first EU country they arrive. Merkel announced that Germany would also process asylum applications from Syrian refugees if they had come to Germany through other EU countries.[127] That year, nearly 1.1 million asylum seekers entered Germany.[128][129] Merkel coined the phrase Wir schaffen das (literally 'We can do this') around this time.[130][131]

Junior coalition partner and Vice Chancellor Sigmar Gabriel said that Germany could take in 500,000 refugees annually for the next several years.[132] German opposition to the government's admission of the new wave of migrants was strong and coupled with a rise in anti-immigration protests.[133] Merkel insisted that Germany had the economic strength to cope with the influx of migrants and reiterated that there is no legal maximum limit on the number of migrants Germany can take.[134] In September 2015, enthusiastic crowds across the country welcomed arriving refugees and migrants.[135]

Horst Seehofer, leader of the Christian Social Union in Bavaria (CSU)—the sister party of Merkel's Christian Democratic Union—and then-Bavarian Minister President, attacked Merkel's policies.[136] Seehofer criticised Merkel's decision to allow in migrants, saying that ""[they were] in a state of mind without rules, without system and without order because of a German decision.""[137] Seehofer argued that as many as 30% of asylum seekers arriving in Germany claiming to be from Syria are in fact from other countries.[138] He argued for a punitive reduction in EU funding for member countries that rejected mandatory refugee quotas.[139] Meanwhile, Yasmin Fahimi, secretary-general of the Social Democratic Party (SPD), the junior partner of the ruling coalition, praised Merkel's policy allowing migrants in Hungary to enter Germany as ""a strong signal of humanity to show that Europe's values are valid also in difficult times"".[136] Merkel's approval rating dropped to 54% in October 2015, the lowest it had been since 2011.[140]

In November 2015, there were talks inside the governing coalition to stop family unification for migrants for two years and to establish ""Transit Zones"" on the border. Additionally, there were plans to provide housing to migrants with a low likelihood of getting approved for asylum until the processing of their application. This led to increased tensions between the CSU, who were generally in favour of these measures and threatened to leave the coalition without them, and the SPD, who opposed them; Merkel agreed to the measures.[141] The November 2015 Paris attacks prompted a reevaluation of the German government's stance on EU migration policy.[142] While she did not directly limit the number of immigrants, Merkel tightened asylum policy in Germany, for example through more thorough vetting of migrants with respect to internal safety and security.[143][142]

In August 2016, following the Würzburg train attack in Germany and various other Islamist terror attacks in Europe, Merkel's approval rating dropped to 47%.[144] Half of Germans did not want her to serve a fourth term in office, with only 42% in favour of another term in office.[145] In a poll from October that year, her approval rating was found to have risen again; 54% of Germans were found to be satisfied with the work of Merkel as Chancellor.[146] According to another poll taken in November 2016, 59% were to found to be in favour of a renewed Chancellorship candidature in 2017.[147] According to a poll carried out shortly after the 2016 Berlin truck attack, 56% of Germans named Merkel as a political leader they trusted to solve their country's problems.[148]

Migrants in Germany, October 2015

In October 2016, Merkel travelled to Mali and Niger. The diplomatic visit took place to discuss how their governments could improve conditions which caused people to flee those countries and how illegal migration through and from these countries could be reduced.[149]

The migrant crisis spurred right-wing electoral preferences across Germany with the Alternative for Germany (AfD) gaining 12% of the vote in the 2017 German federal election. These developments prompted debates over the reasons for increased right-wing populism in Germany. Some researchers have argued that increased right-wing preferences are a result of the European migrant crisis, particularly the increasingly common perception that refugees constitute an ethnic and cultural threat to Germany.[150]

Some observers have described Merkel's policymaking with respect to the migrant crisis as a success.[151] In 2022, the United Nations' High Commissioner for Refugees granted Merkel the Nansen Award for her ""courage and compassion"" during the crisis.[152][153] However, Merkel has also faced significant criticism, particularly with regards to her policymaking early in the crisis, which some critics describe as hypocritically unilateral.[154][155]

2018–2021: Third CDU–SPD grand coalition

Election

In the 2017 federal election, Merkel led her party to victory for the fourth time. However, both the CDU/CSU and the SPD received a significantly lower proportion of the vote than they did in 2013, and the CDU/CSU subsequently attempted to form a coalition with the FDP and Greens.[156][157] The SPD announced that they would go into the Opposition, both due to their loss of popular support and because the idea of another grand coalition was widely unpopular at the time.[158][159][160]

The FDP eventually withdrew from negotiations with the CDU/CSU, leading to a stalemate.[161][162] The German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier subsequently appealed successfully to the SPD to change their hard stance against coalition with the CDU/CSU, and the SPD agreed to a third grand coalition with the CDU/CSU.[163] The negotiations leading up to this agreement were the longest in German post-war history, lasting almost six months.[164][165]

A YouGov survey published in late December 2017 found that just 36% of all respondents wanted Merkel to stay at the helm until 2021, while half of those surveyed voters called for a change at the top before the end of the legislature.[166]

The Fourth Merkel cabinet was sworn in on 14 March 2018.[167]

2018 government crisis

As part of the newly formed government, the CSU's Horst Seehofer took over the role of Interior Minister.[168] Seehofer announced that he had a ""master plan for faster asylum procedures, and more consistent deportations.""[169] Under Seehofer's plan, Germany would immediately reject prospective immigrants who had already been deported or were subject to an entry ban. Additionally, the police would be instructed to turn away all applicants who had previously registered elsewhere in the EU, no matter if these countries agreed to take them back.[170][171] Merkel feared that unilaterally sending migrants back to neighbouring countries without seeking a multilateral European agreement could endanger the stability of the European Union.[172]

In June 2018, Seehofer issued an ultimatum to Merkel; as Interior Minister, he could unilaterally implement the policy without her support. Although he eventually agreed to cooperate with Merkel while she negotiated with other EU member countries, he went on to reject the EU agreement that she obtained.[173] On 1 July 2018, during a meeting with party leadership, Seehofer declared his intention to resign from his position in protest.[174][175][176] During the night of 2 July 2018, Seehofer and Merkel announced they had settled their differences and agreed to instead accept a compromise of tighter border control.[177][178] As a result of the agreement, Seehofer agreed to not resign,[179] and to negotiate bilateral agreements with the specific countries himself. Seehofer received some criticism for his stance in the crisis.[180][181]

COVID-19 pandemic

In the initial phases of the pandemic, Germany established a crisis team to manage Germany's containment policy and pandemic response.[182] In late February 2020, referring to this crisis team, Merkel recommended an approach characterised by moderation and an avoidance of extreme or universal measures (Maß und Mitte).[183]

On 18 March 2020, Merkel gave a widely publicised speech on the COVID-19 pandemic, comparing its challenges to the Second World War:[184]

Please also take this seriously. Since German reunification, no, since the Second World War, there has not been a challenge for our country in which action in a spirit of solidarity on our part was so important. — Angela Merkel

The speech was well-received both nationally and internationally, receiving widespread attention and an award for ""speech of the year"".[185][186][187]

On 6 April 2020, Merkel stated: ""In my view ... the European Union is facing the biggest test since its foundation and member states must show greater solidarity so that the bloc can emerge stronger from the economic crisis unleashed by the pandemic"".[188] Merkel has won international plaudits for her handling of the pandemic in Germany.[189][10]

Later that month, Merkel was praised for her accessible explanation of the basic reproduction number, which had been an important metric in the German government's pandemic response.[190][191][192] Merkel opposed mandatory vaccinations, instead stressing scientific literacy and education.[193]

During the German presidency of the European Council, Merkel spearheaded negotiations for the Next Generation EU reconstruction package.[194]

Succession

On 29 October 2018, Merkel announced that she would not seek reelection as leader of CDU at their party conference in December 2018, but intended to remain as chancellor until the 2021 German federal election was held. She stated that she did not plan to seek any political office after this. The resignations followed October setbacks for the CSU in the Bavarian state election and for the CDU in the Hessian state election.[195][196] In August 2019, Merkel hinted that she might return to academia at the end of her term in 2021.[197]

She decided not to suggest any person as her successor as leader of the CDU.[198] However, political observers had long considered Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer as Merkel's protégé groomed for succession. This view was confirmed when Kramp-Karrenbauer – widely seen as the chancellor's favourite for the post – was voted to succeed Merkel as leader of the CDU in December 2018.[199] Kramp-Karrenbauer's elevation to Defence Minister after Ursula von der Leyen's departure to become president of the European Commission also boosted her standing as Merkel's most likely candidate for succession.[200] In 2019, media outlets speculated that Kramp-Karrenbauer might take over Merkel's position as Chancellor sooner than planned if the current governing coalition proved unsustainable.[201][202] The possibility was neither confirmed nor denied by the party.[203] In February 2020, Kramp-Karrenbauer announced that she would resign as party leader of the CDU in the summer, after party members in Thuringia defied official party lines and voted with Alternative for Germany to support an FDP candidate for minister-president.[204] Kramp-Karrenbauer was succeeded by Armin Laschet at the 2021 CDU leadership election.[205]

In the 2021 federal election, the SPD won the most votes. This necessitated long negotiations among the various parties to form a government. On 23 November 2021, a new grand coalition was announced, with Olaf Scholz nominated to succeed Merkel.[206] Merkel continued to serve as chancellor until 8 December 2021, when Scholz was sworn in.[207] The constituency she had held since its establishment in the German reunification was won by Anna Kassautzki (SPD).[208]

2022–present: Post-chancellorship

On 31 January 2022, less than two months after she left office, her long-time rival Friedrich Merz, who she beat in 2002 to become leader of the opposition, took over as leader of the CDU.[209]

On 25 February 2022, only 24 hours after the Russian invasion of Ukraine began, Merkel told the DPA that she ""condemned in the strongest terms [...] the war of aggression led by Russia, which marks a profound break in the history of post-Cold War Europe.""[210]

In April that year, a spokesperson for Merkel stated that she ""stood by her position at the NATO summit in Bucharest in 2008"", when she had opposed Ukraine's membership in the North Atlantic Alliance, a decision that had come under increased scrutiny.[210]

On 1 June 2022, Merkel made her first semi-public comments about political affairs since leaving office, at a retirement party for Reiner Hoffmann [de ], the president of the German Trade Union Confederation. She criticised the ""blatant violation of international law by Russia"", expressed solidarity with Ukraine, and argued that ""peace and freedom can never be taken for granted.""[210]

On 7 June 2022, Merkel made her first public comments. In an interview with journalist Alexander Osang [de ], she defended her past decisions on Ukraine and called Putin's aggression,[211]

not just unacceptable, but also a major mistake from Russia... It's an objective breach of all international laws and of everything that allows us in Europe to live in peace at all. If we start going back through the centuries and arguing over which bit of territory should belong to whom, then we will only have war. That's not an option whatsoever.

She also said that by the end of her chancellorship in September 2021, it had been clear that Putin was moving in the direction of conflict and that he was finished with the Normandy Format talks.[212]

Following her retirement, Merkel wrote a memoir called Freedom (Freiheit), with her longtime assistant and adviser, Beate Baumann. It was released on November 26, 2024 with the title Freedom: Memories 1954–2021. The book was published in 30 languages and consists of 736 pages.[213][214]

In January 2025, Merkel criticised Friedrich Merz for introducing a non-binding resolution supporting restrictions on immigration that passed in the Bundestag with the help of the AfD.[215]

Political positions

Immigration, refugees and migration

In October 2010, Merkel told a meeting of younger members of her conservative Christian Democratic Union (CDU) party at Potsdam that attempts to build a multicultural society in Germany had ""utterly failed"",[216] stating that: ""The concept that we are now living side by side and are happy about it"" does not work[217] and ""we feel attached to the Christian concept of mankind, that is what defines us. Anyone who doesn't accept that is in the wrong place here.""[218] She continued to say that immigrants should integrate and adopt Germany's culture and values. This added to a growing debate within Germany on the acceptable levels and mechanisms of immigration, its effects on Germany, and the degree to which Muslim immigrants had integrated into German society.[219]

Merkel is in favour of a ""mandatory solidarity mechanism"" for relocation of asylum-seekers from Italy and Greece to other EU member states as part of the long-term solution to Europe's migrant crisis.[220][221]

Foreign policy

Merkel's foreign policy has focused on strengthening European cooperation and international trade agreements. She and her governments have been closely associated with the change through trade (Wandel durch Handel) policy.[98] For this, she has come under criticism, especially after the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine.[222][223] Merkel has been widely described as the de facto leader of the European Union throughout her tenure as Chancellor.[224][225][226]

In 2015, with the absence of Stephen Harper, Merkel became the only leader to have attended every G20 meeting since the first in 2008, having been present at a record fifteen summits as of 2021. She hosted the twelfth meeting at the 2017 G20 Hamburg summit.[227]

Merkel favors the Association Agreement between Ukraine and the European Union. In December 2012, she stated that its implementation depends on reforms in Ukraine.[228]

Merkel expressed support for Israel's right to self-defence in the context of the 2014 Israel–Gaza conflict. She telephoned Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on 9 July to condemn ""without reservation rocket fire on Israel"".[229]

On 20 June 2018, which was World Refugee Day, Merkel said that there had been ""no moral or political justification"" for the post-war expulsion of ethnic Germans from Central and Eastern European countries.[230]

Social expenditure

At the World Economic Forum in Davos, 2013, Merkel said that Europe had only 7% of the global population and produced only 25% of the global GDP, but that it accounted for almost 50% of global social expenditure. She went on to say that Europe could only maintain its prosperity by being innovative and measuring itself against the best.[231] After this, the comparison became a central element in major speeches.[232] The international financial press has widely commented on her thesis, with The Economist saying:

If Mrs Merkel's vision is pragmatic, so too is her plan for implementing it. It can be boiled down to three statistics, a few charts and some facts on an A4 * sheet of paper. The three figures are 7 percent, 25 percent and 50 percent. Mrs Merkel never tires of saying that Europe has 7 percent of the world's population, 25 percent of its GDP and 50 percent of its social spending. If the region is to prosper in competition with emerging countries, it cannot continue to be so generous.[233] ... She produces graphs of unit labour costs ... at EU meetings in much the same way that the late Margaret Thatcher used to pull passages from Friedrich Hayek's Road to Serfdom from her handbag.[233]

The Financial Times commented: ""Although Ms Merkel stopped short of suggesting that a ceiling on social spending might be one yardstick for measuring competitiveness, she hinted as much in the light of soaring social spending in the face of an ageing population.[234]

Climate policy

Merkel has been credited as a key part of 2007 G8 negotiations that led to a significantly more ambitious renewable energy transition commitment than had been anticipated.[235]

In September 2010, the coalition government published a long-term plan for sustainable development of the electrical grid until 2050; efforts to transition to sustainable and otherwise preferable sources of energy have been termed Energy Transition (Energiewende). Although the initial plan was criticised for lifetime extensions of nuclear power plants, it was amended following the Fukushima nuclear disaster, and the last nuclear power plants in Germany were shut down in April 2023.[236][237][238] The plan also aimed at a 40% reduction of greenhouse gas emissions by 2020, a goal that was initially achieved largely due to reductions in demand during the COVID-19 pandemic.[239] However, emissions increased to a level above the target in 2022.[240][241]

In preparation for the 2015 Paris Climate Change Conference, Merkel announced that Germany would significantly increase its contributions to international climate aid and financing by 2020.[242] In 2016, some observers criticised Merkel's lack of action with regards to climate change that year.[243][244] In 2017, Merkel criticised the Trump administration's decision to withdraw from the 2015 Paris Agreement and reaffirmed the commitment of the remaining G20 members to the treaty.[245][246]

In early 2019, a governmental commission appointed by the coalition government approved a plan to phase out coal power plants by 2038, allocating a budget of €40 billion to the plan.[247][248]

In September 2019, the Merkel government announced a set of climate change mitigation policies with a total budget of €54 billion.[249] Although described as a ""new beginning for Germany's climate policy"" by then-minister of the environment Svenja Schulze,[250] the package was widely criticised; environmental protection groups have labelled it insufficient, and opposition parties have argued that it is ineffective.[251][252][253] Prominent climate scientists have called it ""a failure of the political system""[254] and ""ridiculous"".[255]

Fiscal policy

In 2009, Merkel announced plans to take on additional government debt in order to stimulate economic growth, arguing that this should take priority over other fiscal concerns.[256] The Merkel government's tax policy at the time was widely criticised, mostly for taking on additional debt instead of increasing tax rates at high levels of income.[257][258] In 2010, Merkel expressed support for a global financial transaction tax, but was ultimately unsuccessful in international negotiations on the matter.[259][260]

In 2019, Merkel argued for the importance of a balanced government budget, rejecting calls for additional investment to stimulate growth.[261]

Criticism

Merkel has been criticised for being personally present and involved at the M100 Media Award handover[262] to Danish cartoonist Kurt Westergaard, who had triggered the Muhammad cartoons controversy. This happened at a time of fierce debate over a book by the former Deutsche Bundesbank executive and finance senator of Berlin Thilo Sarrazin, which was critical of Muslim immigration.[263] At the same time, she condemned a planned burning of Qurans by a fundamentalist pastor in Florida.[264] The Central Council of Muslims in Germany[265][266] and the Left Party[267] (Die Linke) as well as the German Green Party[e][268] criticised the action by the centre-right chancellor. The Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung newspaper wrote: ""This will probably be the most explosive moment of her chancellorship so far.""[269]

The term alternativlos (German for ""without an alternative""), which was frequently used by Angela Merkel to describe her measures addressing the European sovereign-debt crisis, was named the Un-word of the Year 2010 by a jury of linguistic scholars. The wording was criticised as undemocratic, as any discussion on Merkel's politics would thus be deemed unnecessary or undesirable.[270] The expression is credited for the name of the political party Alternative for Germany, which was founded in 2013.[271]

During a visit of U.S. President Barack Obama in Berlin, Merkel said on 19 June 2013 in the context of the 2013 mass surveillance disclosures: ""The Internet is uncharted territory for us all"" (German: Das Internet ist für uns alle Neuland). This statement led to various internet memes and online mockery of Merkel.[272][273]

During a state visit of the Turkish prime minister Ahmet Davutoğlu in January 2015, Merkel stated that ""Islam is part of Germany"", which induced criticism from within her party. Parliamentary group leader Volker Kauder stated that Muslims belong to Germany, but Islam does not, and that Muslims should ""ask themselves why so many violent people refer to the Quran.""[274][275]

At the conclusion of the May 2017 Group of Seven's leaders in Sicily, Merkel criticised American efforts to renege on earlier commitments on climate change. According to Merkel, the discussions were difficult and marred by dissent. ""Here we have the situation where six members, or even seven if you want to add the EU, stand against one.""[276]

Merkel has faced criticism for failing to take a tough line on the People's Republic of China.[277][278][279] The Asia Times reported that ""Unlike certain of her European counterparts, her China diplomacy has focused on non-interference in Beijing's internal affairs. As such, Merkel was reportedly furious when her Foreign Minister Heiko Maas received Hong Kong dissident Joshua Wong in Berlin in September [2019], a move that Beijing publicly protested.""[280]

Merkel's government decided to phase out both nuclear power and coal plants and supported the European Commission's Green Deal plans.[281][282] Critics blamed the European Union Emissions Trading System (EU ETS) and closure of nuclear plants for contributing to the 2021–2022 global energy crisis.[282][283][284]

Following the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, Merkel faced renewed criticisms that she had failed to curb Russian president Vladimir Putin's ambitions and aggression by insisting on diplomacy and détente policies.[285][286][287] Critics argued that under her tenure, Germany and Europe was weakened by a dependency on Russian natural gas, including the Nord Stream 1 and Nord Stream 2 pipelines,[285][286] and that the German military was neglected, disorganised, and underfunded.[288][287] By late 2021, Germany was importing 55% of its gas, 34% of its oil, and 52% of its coal from Russia.[289]

Merkel's chancellorship has become tightly associated with the policy of Wandel durch Handel, which advocates pursuing close economic ties with authoritarian governments with the goal of inducing democratization. When the Wandel durch Handel policy came under intense domestic and international scrutiny following the Russian invasion, Merkel received much of the blame,[98][223] leading Politico to write ""[n]o German is more responsible for the crisis in Ukraine than Merkel"".[222] Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy also blamed Merkel and then-French president Nicolas Sarkozy's decision to block Ukraine from joining NATO in 2008 for the war; Merkel released a statement that she stands by her decision,[290] later adding that the war would have broken out earlier at a greater military disadvantage for Ukraine.[291]

Legacy and public image

International perceptions

Angela Merkel's tenure as Chancellor compared to heads of government in the EU and UK

Merkel was widely described as the de facto leader of the European Union throughout her tenure as Chancellor. She was named the world's second most powerful person by Forbes magazine in 2012 and 2015, following Barack Obama and Vladimir Putin respectively, the highest ranking ever achieved by a woman.[292][293][294] On 26 March 2014, Merkel became the longest-serving incumbent head of government in the European Union. In December 2015, Merkel was named as Time magazine's Person of the Year, with the magazine's cover declaring her to be the ""Chancellor of the Free World"".[295] In 2018, Merkel was named the most powerful woman in the world for a record fourteenth time by Forbes.[296] Following the election of Donald Trump to the US presidency in 2016, Merkel was described by The New York Times as ""the Liberal West's Last Defender"",[297] and as the ""leader of the free world"" by a number of commentators, including Hillary Clinton.[298][299][300] In a 2018 survey, Merkel was found to be the most widely respected world leader.[301] The Atlantic described her in 2019 as ""the world's most successful living politician, on the basis of both achievement and longevity"".[302] Harvard University President Larry Bacow described her as ""one of the most widely admired and broadly influential statespeople of our time"".[303]

Critics have argued that Merkel's policymaking during the 2015 migrant crisis has damaged the integrity of the EU.[154][304][155] Some have also commented that Germany's failure to meet financial commitments to NATO,[117] Merkel's blocking of the accession of Ukraine to NATO in 2008,[305] and the abolishment of conscription have together weakened the positions of Germany and Europe following the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

In 2023, Merkel received a doctorate honoris causa from the Paris Institute of Political Sciences in recognition of her political career.[306][307]

Domestic image

Merkel has been described as having significantly shaped the political landscape of Germany, particularly the perceptions of those who grew up during her chancellorship; this demographic group has been referred to Merkelkinder ( transl. children of Merkel).[308][309]

Comparisons

As a woman who is a politician from a centre-right party and also a scientist, Merkel has been compared by many in the English-language press to 20th century British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. Thatcher also had a science degree from Oxford University in chemistry. Some have referred to her as ""Iron Lady"", ""Iron Girl"", and even ""The Iron Frau"", all alluding to Thatcher, whose nickname was ""The Iron Lady"". Political commentators have debated the precise extent to which their agendas are similar.[310] Later in her tenure, Merkel acquired the nickname ""Mutti"" (a German familiar form of ""mother""). She has also been called the ""Iron Chancellor"", in reference to Otto von Bismarck.[311][312]

Al Jazeera has criticised the ""Iron Lady"" nickname for Merkel as ""wrong-headed"", noting her pro-European stance, her efforts to combat ""profit-seeking speculators"" during the euro crisis, and her lacking Thatcher's ""my-way-or-the-highway"" attitude towards politics.[313]

Personal life

In 1977, at the age of 23, Merkel, then Angela Kasner, married physics student Ulrich Merkel (born 1953)[314] and took his surname. The couple divorced in 1982.[315] Her second and current husband is quantum chemist and professor Joachim Sauer, who has largely avoided media attention during and after Merkel's political career.[316][317] They first met in 1981[318] and married in 1998.[319] Merkel has no children, but Sauer has two adult sons from a previous marriage.[320]

Having grown up in East Germany, Merkel learned Russian at school. She was able to speak informally to Vladimir Putin in Russian but conducted diplomatic dialogue through an interpreter. She rarely spoke English in public but delivered a small section of an address to the British Parliament in English in 2014.[321][322]

Merkel is a fervent football fan and was known to listen to games while in the Bundestag and to attend games of the national team in her official capacity, including Germany's 1–0 victory against Argentina in the 2014 World Cup Final.[323][324][325]

Merkel has stated that her favorite film is The Legend of Paul and Paula, an East German movie released in 1973.[326]

Merkel has a fear of dogs, which developed after she was attacked by one in 1995.[327] Vladimir Putin brought in his Labrador Retriever during a press conference in 2007. Putin claims he did not mean to scare her, though Merkel later observed, ""I understand why he has to do this – to prove he's a man. ... He's afraid of his own weakness.""[327]

Since 2017, Merkel has occasionally been seen shaking visibly on several public occasions, recovering shortly afterwards.[328][329][330] After one such occasion, she attributed the shaking to dehydration, saying that she felt better after a drink of water.[331]

In September 2021, after evading the question for most of her career, Merkel said that she considered herself a feminist. The statement came in a conference along with Nigerian writer and feminist Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie.[332]

Since her retirement, Merkel has commented on the Russian invasion of Ukraine but has otherwise limited her involvement in political matters. She has instead focused on travelling, attending only ""feel-good events"" (Wohlfühltermine) in a private capacity.[333][334]

Merkel reportedly ""detested"" U.S. President Donald Trump, according to Politico, citing a forthcoming book by Jonathan Karl.[335]

Religion

Angela Merkel is a Lutheran member of the Evangelical Church in Berlin, Brandenburg and Silesian Upper Lusatia (German: Evangelische Kirche Berlin-Brandenburg-schlesische Oberlausitz – EKBO), a United Protestant (i.e. both Reformed and Lutheran) church body under the umbrella of the Protestant Church in Germany. The EKBO is a member of the Union of Protestant Churches in the EKD.[336] Before the 2004 merger of the Evangelical Church in Berlin-Brandenburg and the Evangelical Church in Silesian Upper Lusatia, Merkel belonged to the former. In 2012, Merkel said, regarding her faith: ""I am a member of the Protestant Church. I believe in God and religion is also my constant companion, and has been for the whole of my life. We as Christians should above all not be afraid of standing up for our beliefs.""[337] She also publicly declared that Germany suffers not from ""too much Islam"" but ""too little Christianity"".[338]

In the arts and media

Since 1991, Merkel has sat annually for sitting and standing portraits by, and interview with, Herlinde Koelbl.[339][340]

Merkel was portrayed by Swiss actress Anna Katarina in the 2012 political satire film The Dictator.[341]

Merkel features as a main character in two of the three plays that make up the Europeans Trilogy (Bruges, Antwerp, and Tervuren) by Paris-based UK playwright Nick Awde: Bruges (2014) and Tervuren (2016). A character named Merkel, accompanied by a sidekick called Schäuble, also appears as the sinister female henchman in Michael Paraskos's novel In Search of Sixpence.[342]

On the American sketch-comedy series Saturday Night Live, Merkel has been parodied by Kate McKinnon.[343][344][345]

On the British sketch-comedy Tracey Ullman's Show, comedian Tracey Ullman has parodied Merkel to international acclaim.[346][347][348][349]

In 2016, a documentary film Angela Merkel – The Unexpected was produced by Broadview TV and MDR in collaboration with Arte and Das Erste.[350]

In 2024, a German TV show called 'Miss Merkel' reimagined her as a detective.[351] It is based on the bestselling novels by German writer David Safier and is a comedy that was a hit in Germany and then shown on public broadcaster RAI, dubbed into Italian.[352]

Top Questions Where was Angela Merkel educated? Merkel finished (1973) high school in Templin, East Germany, and received (1978) a bachelor’s degree in physics at Karl Marx University (now the University of Leipzig). She then worked at the Central Institute of Physical Chemistry of the Academy of Sciences in East Berlin, earning (1986) a doctorate for her thesis on quantum chemistry. What did Angela Merkel accomplish? During her time as the first female chancellor of Germany, Merkel was a leading figure in European politics, championing austerity as the path to recovery for Europe’s damaged economies. Faced with Europe’s gravest refugee crisis since World War II, she maintained that Germany would keep its borders open in the face of the humanitarian emergency. What did Angela Merkel do to help the world? When hundreds of thousands of migrants fleeing conflicts in Syria, Afghanistan, and elsewhere flocked to the European Union, Merkel advocated for the resettlement of large numbers of people in Germany. As a result, more than one million migrants entered Germany in 2015 alone, sparing them the danger of having to return to their war-torn countries.

Angela Merkel (born July 17, 1954, Hamburg, West Germany) is a German politician who served as chancellor of Germany from 2005 to 2021. She was the first woman to hold that office and the second longest-serving chancellor in German history.

Early life Merkel’s parents, Horst and Herlind Kasner, met in Hamburg, where her father was a theology student and her mother was a teacher of Latin and English. After completing his education, her father accepted a pastorate in Quitzow, Brandenburg, and the family relocated to East Germany (German Democratic Republic) just weeks after Merkel’s birth. In 1957 they moved again to Templin, where Merkel finished high school in 1973. Later that year she went to Leipzig to study physics at Karl Marx University (now the University of Leipzig). There she met her first husband, fellow physics student Ulrich Merkel, and the two were married in 1977. After earning her diploma in 1978, she worked as a member of the academic faculty at the Central Institute of Physical Chemistry of the Academy of Sciences in East Berlin. In 1982 Merkel and her husband divorced, though she kept his last name. She was awarded a doctorate for her thesis on quantum chemistry in 1986. As was the case for most children growing up in the German Democratic Republic, Merkel participated in the state’s youth organizations. She was a member of the Young Pioneers (from 1962) and the Free German Youth (from 1968). Her involvement with the Free German Youth has led to controversy, as some of her former colleagues from the Central Institute of Physical Chemistry claimed that she was active as a secretary for agitation and propaganda at the institute, though Merkel maintained that she was responsible for cultural affairs (e.g., procuring theatre tickets). Merkel was not nor did she apply to be a member of the Socialist Unity Party, and when approached by personnel of the Ministry for State Security (Stasi) to become an informant, she refused."

Former German Chancellor Angela Merkel has made a highly unusual intervention to criticise her one-time political rival

This is a highly unusual intervention by the woman who led Germany for 16 years, stepping in to criticise the actions of her former political rival.

The parliament descended into heckles on Wednesday after votes from the far-right party meant a non-binding CDU motion on tougher immigration rules was passed.

In a statement, Merkel accused CDU leader Friedrich Merz of turning his back on a previous pledge not to work with AfD in the Bundestag.

Germany's former Chancellor Angela Merkel has criticised her own party leader for passing a motion in parliament with support from the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD).

Merz, who is tipped to be Germany's next chancellor due to CDU's lead in the polls, said on Wednesday that a policy was not wrong just because the ""wrong people back it"" and that he had not sought nor wanted AfD's support.

But Merkel accused him of breaking a pledge he made in November to work with the Social Democratic Party and the Greens to pass legislation, not AfD.

This was to ensure ""neither in determining the agenda nor in voting on the matter here in the House will there be a random or actually brought about majority with those from the AfD,"" read a quote from Merz in Merkel's statement.

The former chancellor said she fully supported this earlier ""expression of great state political responsibility"".

""I think it is wrong to no longer feel bound by this proposal and thereby knowingly allow the AfD to gain a majority in a vote in the German Bundestag on 29 January 2025 for the first time.""

She said ""all democratic parties"" needed to work together ""to do everything they can to prevent such terrible attacks in the future as those that took place shortly before Christmas in Magdeburg and a few days ago in Aschaffenburg"".

This is a rare intervention from Merkel.

To openly criticise her own party's candidate for chancellor – just weeks out from an election – is a big move and will add rocket fuel to a an already explosive story in German politics.

Merkel and Merz go back a long way - and not as the best of friends.

He was famously side-lined by Merkel in the early 2000s after she won out in a CDU power struggle.

Merz would go on to quit front-line politics for many years before making his return.

Since then, he has criticized Merkel's legacy – particularly her handling of the migration crisis.

They also have very different visions for the party, with Merkel seen as a more pragmatic centrist and Merz from the CDU's more traditional, conservative wing.

Wednesday's vote broke a longstanding taboo in German politics – and Merz is also due to propose legislation on Friday that the AfD could support.

The current German Chancellor, Olaf Scholz, called the move an ""unforgivable mistake"".

""Since the founding of the Federal Republic of Germany over 75 years ago, there has always been a clear consensus among all democrats in our parliaments: we do not make common cause with the far right,"" he said."

Alexander Boris de Pfeffel Johnson (born 19 June 1964) is a British politician and writer who served as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom and Leader of the Conservative Party from 2019 to 2022. He was previously Foreign Secretary from 2016 to 2018 and Mayor of London from 2008 to 2016. He was Member of Parliament (MP) for Henley from 2001 to 2008 and for Uxbridge and South Ruislip from 2015 to 2023.

In his youth Johnson attended Eton College and Balliol College, Oxford, and he was elected president of the Oxford Union in 1986. In 1989 he began writing for The Daily Telegraph, and from 1999 to 2005 he was the editor of The Spectator. He became a member of the Shadow Cabinet of Michael Howard in 2001 before being dismissed over a claim that he had lied about an extramarital affair. After Howard resigned Johnson became a member of David Cameron's Shadow Cabinet. He was elected mayor of London in 2008 and resigned from the House of Commons to focus his attention on the mayoralty. He was re-elected mayor in 2012, but did not run for re-election in 2016. At the 2015 general election he was elected MP for Uxbridge and South Ruislip. Johnson was a prominent figure in the Brexit campaign in the 2016 EU membership referendum. After the referendum Prime Minister Theresa May appointed him foreign secretary. He resigned from the position in 2018 in protest at both the Chequers Agreement and May's approach to Brexit.

Johnson succeeded May as prime minister. He re-opened Brexit negotiations with the EU and in early September he prorogued Parliament; the Supreme Court later ruled the prorogation to have been unlawful. After agreeing to a revised Brexit withdrawal agreement but failing to win parliamentary support, Johnson called a snap general election to be held in December 2019, in which he won a landslide victory. During Johnson's premiership, the government responded to the COVID-19 pandemic by introducing various emergency powers to mitigate its impact and approved a nationwide vaccination programme. He also responded to the Russian invasion of Ukraine by imposing sanctions on Russia and authorising foreign aid and weapons shipments to Ukraine.[1] In the Partygate scandal it was found that numerous parties had been held at 10 Downing Street during national COVID-19 lockdowns, and COVID-19 social distancing laws were breached by 83 individuals, including Johnson, who in April 2022 was issued with a fixed penalty notice. The publishing of the Sue Gray report in May 2022 and a widespread sense of dissatisfaction led in June 2022 to a vote of confidence in his leadership amongst Conservative MPs, which he won. In July 2022, revelations over his appointment of Chris Pincher as deputy chief whip of the party while knowing of allegations of sexual misconduct against him led to a mass resignation of members of his government and to Johnson announcing his resignation as prime minister. He was succeeded as prime minister by Liz Truss, his foreign secretary. He remained in the House of Commons as a backbencher until June 2023, when he received the draft of the Commons Privileges Committee investigation into his conduct that unanimously found that he had lied to the Commons on numerous occasions. Johnson resigned his position as MP the same day.

Johnson is a controversial figure in British politics. His supporters have praised him for being humorous, witty and entertaining, with an appeal that reaches beyond traditional Conservative Party voters, viewing him as an electoral asset to the party. Conversely, his critics have accused him of lying, elitism, cronyism and bigotry. During his premiership his supporters praised him for ""getting Brexit done"", overseeing the UK's COVID-19 vaccination programme, which was amongst the fastest in the world, and being one of the first world leaders to offer humanitarian support to Ukraine following the Russian invasion of the country. His tenure also encompassed several controversies and scandals, and is viewed as the most scandalous premiership of modern times by historians and biographers alike.

Early life and education

Childhood

Alexander Boris de Pfeffel Johnson was born on 19 June 1964 in the Upper East Side of Manhattan, New York City,[2] to Stanley Johnson, then studying economics at Columbia University, and Charlotte Fawcett,[5] an artist, whose father Sir James Fawcett, was a prominent barrister and president of the European Commission of Human Rights from 1972 to 1981.[6] Johnson is one of only two British prime ministers to have been an American citizen (see Honorary citizenship of the United States).[7][8] Johnson's parents returned to the UK in September 1964 so Charlotte could study at the University of Oxford. She lived with her son in Summertown, Oxford, and in September 1965 she gave birth to a daughter, Rachel. In July 1965, the family moved to Crouch End in north London, and in February 1966 they relocated to Washington, DC, where Stanley worked with the World Bank. Stanley then took a job with a policy panel on population control, and moved the family to Norwalk, Connecticut, in June. A third child, Leo, was born in September 1967.

Ashdown House preparatory school, East Sussex, attended by Johnson from 1975 to 1977

The family returned to the UK in 1969, and lived at West Nethercote Farm, Somerset, Stanley's family home in Exmoor. His father was regularly absent, leaving Johnson to be raised largely by his mother, assisted by au pairs. As a child, Johnson was quiet, studious, and deaf, resulting in several operations to insert grommets into his ears. He and his siblings were encouraged to engage in intellectual activities from a young age. Johnson's earliest recorded ambition was to be ""world king"". Having no other friends, the siblings became very close.

In late 1969, the family moved to Maida Vale in west London, while Stanley began post-graduate research at the London School of Economics. In 1970 Charlotte and the children briefly returned to Nethercote, where Johnson attended Winsford Village School, before returning to London to settle in Primrose Hill, where they were educated at Primrose Hill Primary School. A fourth child, Joseph, was born in late 1971.

After Stanley secured employment at the European Commission in April 1973, he moved his family to Uccle, Brussels, where Johnson attended the European School, Brussels I and learnt to speak French.[26] Charlotte had a nervous breakdown and was hospitalised with depression, after which Johnson and his siblings were sent back to the UK in 1975 to attend Ashdown House, a preparatory boarding school in East Sussex. There, he developed interests in rugby, Ancient Greek, and Latin. In December 1978 his parents' relationship broke down; they divorced in 1980, and Charlotte moved to Notting Hill, London, where her children joined her for much of their time.

Eton and Oxford: 1977–1987

As a kid I was extremely spotty, extremely nerdy and horribly swotty. My idea of a really good time was to travel across London on the tube to visit the British Museum. — Boris Johnson

Johnson gained a King's Scholarship to study at Eton College, a boarding school near Windsor, Berkshire. Arriving in the autumn term of 1977, he began going by his middle name Boris,[34] and developed ""the eccentric English persona"" for which he became famous. He denounced Catholicism and joined the Church of England. School reports complained about his idleness, complacency, and lateness, but he was popular at Eton.

Johnson's friends were largely from the wealthy upper classes; his best friends were Darius Guppy and Charles Spencer. Both would go on to accompany him at the University of Oxford and remained his friends into adulthood. Johnson excelled in English and the Classics, winning prizes in both, and became secretary of the school debating society and editor of the school newspaper. In late 1981 he became a member of Pop, a small, self-selecting elite group of school prefects. After leaving Eton, Johnson went on a gap year to Australia, where he taught English and Latin at Timbertop, an Outward Bound-inspired campus of Geelong Grammar, an independent boarding school.[44][45]

Johnson won a scholarship to read Literae humaniores at Balliol College, Oxford, a four-year course in Classics, ancient languages, literature, history, and philosophy. Matriculating in late 1983, he was one of a generation of Oxford undergraduates who dominated British politics and media in the early 21st century, including Cameron, William Hague, Michael Gove, Jeremy Hunt and Nick Boles. While at Oxford, Johnson joined the college's rugby union team as a tighthead prop.[49] To his later regret, he joined the Bullingdon Club, an exclusive drinking society notorious for vandalism.[51][52] Many years later, a group photograph including himself and Cameron in Bullingdon Club formal dress led to much negative press coverage. While at Oxford, he began a relationship with Allegra Mostyn-Owen, cover girl for Tatler magazine and daughter of Christie's Education chairman William Mostyn-Owen. They became engaged.

Johnson was popular and well known at Oxford. Alongside Guppy, he edited the university's satirical magazine Tributary. In 1984, Johnson was elected secretary of the Oxford Union, and campaigned unsuccessfully for the position of Union President. In 1986, Johnson ran successfully for President, but his term was not distinguished or memorable, and questions were raised regarding his competence and seriousness. At graduation, Johnson was awarded an upper second-class degree,[62] and was deeply unhappy he did not receive a first.

Early career

The Times and The Daily Telegraph: 1987–1994

In September 1987, Johnson and Mostyn-Owen married. They settled in West Kensington, London. In late 1987, through family connections, he began work as a graduate trainee at The Times. Scandal erupted when Johnson wrote an article for the newspaper on the archaeological discovery of Edward II's palace, having invented a quote which he falsely attributed to the historian Colin Lucas, his godfather. After the paper's editor, Charles Wilson, learnt of the matter, he dismissed Johnson.

Johnson secured employment on the lead-writing desk of The Daily Telegraph, having met its editor, Max Hastings, while at university. His articles appealed to the newspaper's Conservative-voting ""Middle England"" readership, and he was known for his distinctive literary style, replete with old-fashioned phrasing and for regularly referring to the readership as ""my friends"". In early 1989, Johnson was appointed to the newspaper's Brussels bureau to report on the European Commission, remaining in the post until 1994.[72] A strong critic of the integrationist Commission president Jacques Delors, he established himself as one of the city's few Eurosceptic journalists. He wrote articles about euromyths: that Brussels had recruited sniffer dogs to ensure that all manure smelt the same, they were about to dictate the acceptable curve of British bananas,[b] limit the power of their vacuum cleaners[76][c] and order women to return their old sex toys. He wrote that euro notes made people impotent and that a plan to blow up the Berlaymont building was in place because asbestos cladding made the building too dangerous to inhabit. Many of his fellow journalists were critical of his articles, saying they often contained lies designed to discredit the commission. The Europhile Conservative politician Chris Patten later said that Johnson was ""one of the greatest exponents of fake journalism"".[72] Johnson opposed banning handguns after the Dunblane school massacre, writing in his column ""Nanny is confiscating their toys. It is like one of those vast Indian programmes of compulsory vasectomy.""[80]

According to one of his biographers, Sonia Purnell, – who was Johnson's Brussels deputy[72] – he helped make Euroscepticism ""an attractive and emotionally resonant cause for the Right"", whereas it had been associated previously with the Left. Johnson's articles exacerbated tensions between the Conservative Party's Eurosceptic and Europhile factions. As a result, he earned the mistrust of many party members. His writings were also a key influence on the emergence of the eurosceptic UK Independence Party (UKIP) in the early 1990s. Conrad Black, then proprietor of The Daily Telegraph, said Johnson ""was such an effective correspondent for us in Brussels that he greatly influenced British opinion on this country's relations with Europe"".[83]

In February 1990 Johnson's wife Allegra broke up with him; after several attempts at reconciliation, their marriage ended in April 1993.[85] He began a relationship with childhood friend Marina Wheeler, who had moved to Brussels in 1990. They were married in May 1993. Soon after, Marina gave birth to a daughter. Johnson and his new wife settled in Islington, north London, an area known for its association with the left-liberal intelligentsia. Under the influence of this milieu and of his wife, Johnson moved in a more liberal direction on issues such as climate change, LGBT rights and race relations. While in Islington, the couple had three more children, all given the surname Johnson-Wheeler. They were sent to the local Canonbury Primary School and then to private secondary schools. Devoting much time to his children, Johnson wrote a book of verse, The Perils of the Pushy Parents: A Cautionary Tale, which was published to largely poor reviews.

Political columnist: 1994–1999

Back in London, Hastings turned down Johnson's request to become a war reporter, instead promoting him to assistant editor and chief political columnist. Johnson's column received praise for being ideologically eclectic and distinctively written, and earned him Commentator of the Year Award at the What the Papers Say awards. Some critics condemned his writing style as bigotry; in columns he used the words ""piccaninnies"" and ""watermelon smiles"" when referring to Africans, championed European colonialism in Uganda[98][99] and referred to gay men as ""tank-topped bumboys"".

In 1993, Johnson outlined his desire to run as a Conservative in the 1994 European Parliament elections. Andrew Mitchell convinced Major not to veto Johnson's candidacy, but Johnson could not find a constituency. He turned his attention to obtaining a seat in the House of Commons instead. After being rejected as Conservative candidate for Holborn and St. Pancras, he was selected the Conservative candidate for Clwyd South in north Wales, then a Labour Party safe seat. Spending six weeks campaigning, he attained 9,091 votes (23 per cent) in the 1997 general election, losing to Labour candidate Martyn Jones.

Scandal erupted in June 1995 when a recording of a 1990 telephone conversation between Johnson and his friend Darius Guppy was made public. In it, Guppy said that his criminal activities involving insurance fraud were being investigated by News of the World journalist Stuart Collier, and he asked Johnson to provide him with Collier's private address, seeking to have the latter beaten. Johnson agreed, although he expressed concern that he would be associated with the attack. When the phone conversation was published, Johnson stated that ultimately he had not obliged Guppy's request. Hastings reprimanded Johnson but did not dismiss him.

Johnson was given a regular column in The Spectator, sister publication to The Daily Telegraph, which attracted mixed reviews and was often thought rushed. In 1999, he was also given a column reviewing new cars in the American men's monthly magazine GQ. The large number of parking fines that Johnson acquired while testing cars frustrated staff. At The Daily Telegraph and The Spectator, he was consistently late delivering copy, forcing staff to stay late to accommodate him; some related that if they published without his work, he would shout at them with expletives.

Johnson's April 1998 appearance on the BBC's satirical current affairs show Have I Got News for You brought him national fame.[107] He was invited back on to later episodes, including as a guest presenter; for his 2003 appearance, Johnson was nominated for the BAFTA Television Award for Best Entertainment Performance.[109] After these appearances, he came to be recognised on the street, and was invited to appear on other shows, such as Top Gear, Parkinson, Breakfast with Frost, and Question Time.

The Spectator and MP for Henley: 1999–2008

In July 1999, Conrad Black offered Johnson the editorship of The Spectator on the condition he abandon his parliamentary aspirations; Johnson agreed. While retaining The Spectator's traditional right-wing bent, Johnson welcomed contributions from leftist writers and cartoonists. Under Johnson's editorship, the magazine's circulation grew by 10% to 62,000 and it became profitable. His editorship also drew criticism; some opined that under him The Spectator avoided serious issues, while colleagues became annoyed that he was regularly absent from the office, meetings, and events. He gained a reputation as a poor political pundit because of incorrect political predictions. His father-in-law Charles Wheeler and others strongly criticised him for allowing Spectator columnist Taki Theodoracopulos to publish racist and antisemitic language.[117]

Journalist Charlotte Edwardes wrote in The Times in 2019 that Johnson had squeezed her thigh at a private lunch at the Spectator in 1999 and that another woman had told her he had done the same to her. A spokesman denied the allegation.[118][119]

In 2004, Johnson published an editorial in The Spectator after the murder of Ken Bigley suggesting that Liverpudlians were wallowing in their victim status and ""hooked on grief"" over the Hillsborough disaster, which Johnson partly blamed on ""drunken fans"".[120][121] In an appendix added to a later edition of his 2005 book The Dream of Rome, Tell MAMA and the Muslim Council of Britain criticised Johnson for arguing Islam has caused the Muslim world to be ""literally centuries behind"" the West.[122]

Becoming an MP

The selection of Boris Johnson ... confirms the Tory Party's increasing weakness for celebrity personalities over the dreary exigencies of politics. Johnson, for all his gifts, is unlikely to grace any future Tory cabinet. Indeed, he is not known for his excessive interest in serious policy matters, and it is hard to see him grubbing away at administrative detail as an obscure, hardworking junior minister for social security. To maintain his funny man reputation he will no doubt find himself refining his Bertie Wooster interpretation to the point where the impersonation becomes the man. –Max Hastings, London Evening Standard,

Following Michael Heseltine's retirement, Johnson decided to stand as Conservative candidate for Henley, a Conservative safe seat in Oxfordshire. The local Conservative branch selected him although it was split over Johnson's candidacy. Some thought him amusing and charming while others disliked his flippant attitude and perceived lack of knowledge of the local area. Assisted by his television fame, Johnson won the seat in the 2001 general election. Alongside his Islington home, Johnson bought a farmhouse outside Thame in his new constituency. He regularly attended Henley social events and occasionally wrote for the Henley Standard. His constituency surgeries proved popular, and he joined local campaigns to stop the closure of Townlands Hospital and the local air ambulance.

In Parliament, Johnson was appointed to a standing committee assessing the Proceeds of Crime Bill, but missed many of its meetings. Despite his credentials as a public speaker, his speeches in the House of Commons were widely deemed lacklustre. He attended around half of Commons votes, usually supporting the Conservative party line. In free votes, he demonstrated a more socially liberal attitude, supporting the Gender Recognition Act 2004 and the repeal of Section 28.[134][135] In 2001 Johnson had spoken out against plans to repeal Section 28, saying it was ""Labour's appalling agenda, encouraging the teaching of homosexuality in schools"".[136][137] After initially stating he would not, he supported the government's plans to join the United States in the 2003 invasion of Iraq, and in April 2003 visited occupied Baghdad. In August 2004, he backed unsuccessful impeachment procedures against Prime Minister Tony Blair for ""high crimes and misdemeanours"" regarding the war,[139] and in December 2006 described the invasion as ""a colossal mistake and misadventure"".

Although labelling Johnson ""ineffably duplicitous"" for breaking his promise not to become an MP, Black decided not to dismiss him because he ""helped promote the magazine and raise its circulation"". Johnson remained editor of The Spectator, while also writing columns for The Daily Telegraph and GQ, and making television appearances. His 2001 book, Friends, Voters, Countrymen: Jottings on the Stump, recounted that year's election campaign, while 2003's Lend Me Your Ears collected previously published columns and articles. In 2004, HarperCollins published his first novel: Seventy-Two Virgins: A Comedy of Errors revolved around the life of a Conservative MP and contained autobiographical elements. Responding to criticism that he was juggling too many jobs, he cited Winston Churchill and Benjamin Disraeli as exemplars who combined political and literary careers. To manage stress, he took up jogging and cycling, and became so well known for the latter that Andrew Gimson suggested he was ""perhaps the most famous cyclist in Britain"".

Following William Hague's resignation as Conservative leader, the party elected Iain Duncan Smith. Johnson had a strained relationship with Duncan Smith, and The Spectator became critical of his party leadership. Duncan Smith was succeeded by Michael Howard in November 2003; Howard deemed Johnson to be the most popular Conservative politician with the electorate and appointed him vice-chairman of the party, responsible for overseeing its electoral campaign. In his Shadow Cabinet reshuffle of May 2004, Howard appointed Johnson as shadow arts minister. In October, Howard ordered Johnson to apologise publicly in Liverpool for publishing a Spectator article – anonymously written by Simon Heffer – which said the crowds at the Hillsborough disaster had contributed to the incident and that Liverpudlians had a predilection for reliance on the welfare state.[154]

In November 2004, the tabloids revealed that since 2000 Johnson had been having an affair with Spectator columnist Petronella Wyatt, resulting in two abortions. Johnson denied the allegations but they were subsequently proven to be true, and Howard dismissed him as vice-chairman and shadow arts minister when he refused to resign.[157][158]

Second term

As shadow minister for higher education, Johnson visited various universities (as here at the University of Nottingham in 2006)

Johnson in 2007

At the 2005 general election, Johnson was re-elected MP for Henley. Labour won the election and Howard stood down as Conservative leader; Johnson backed David Cameron as his successor. After Cameron was elected, he appointed Johnson as the shadow higher education minister. Interested in streamlining university funding, Johnson supported Labour's proposed top-up fees. He campaigned in 2006 to become the Rector of the University of Edinburgh, but his support for top-up fees damaged his campaign, and he came third.[165]

In April 2006, the News of the World alleged that Johnson was having an affair with journalist Anna Fazackerley; the pair did not comment, and shortly afterwards Johnson began employing Fazackerley.[167] In September 2006, Papua New Guinea's High Commission protested after he compared the Conservatives' frequently changing leadership to cannibalism in the country.

In 2005, The Spectator's new chief executive, Andrew Neil, dismissed Johnson as editor. To make up for this loss of income, Johnson negotiated with The Daily Telegraph to raise his salary from £200,000 to £250,000, averaging £5,000 per column.[171] He presented a popular history television show, The Dream of Rome, which was broadcast in January 2006; a book followed in February. A sequel, After Rome, focused on early Islamic history. In 2007 he earned £540,000, making him the third-highest-earning MP that year.

Mayor of London (2008–2016)

Mayoral election: 2007–2008

Johnson pledged to replace the city's articulated buses with New Routemaster buses if elected mayor

In September, Johnson was selected as the Conservative candidate for Mayor of London after a public London-wide primary.[176] Johnson's campaign focused on reducing youth crime, making public transport safer, and replacing the articulated buses with an updated version of the AEC Routemaster. Targeting the Conservative-leaning suburbs of outer London, it capitalised on perceptions that the Labour Mayoralty had neglected them in favour of inner London. His campaign emphasised his popularity, even among those who opposed his policies, with opponents complaining a common attitude among voters was: ""I'm voting for Boris because he is a laugh."" The campaign of Labour incumbent Ken Livingstone portrayed Johnson as an out-of-touch toff and bigot.

In the election, Johnson received 43% and Livingstone 37% of first-preference votes; when second-preference votes were added, Johnson was victorious with 53% to Livingstone's 47%.[182] Johnson subsequently announced his intention to stand down as MP for Henley.[184]

First term: 2008–2012

After Johnson became mayor, those in City Hall deemed too closely allied to Livingstone's administration had their employment terminated. Johnson appointed Tim Parker as his deputy mayor, but after Parker began taking increasing control at City Hall, Johnson dismissed him. Many in the Conservative Party initially distanced themselves from Johnson's administration, fearing it would be damaging for the 2010 general election.

Johnson gave a victory speech in City Hall after being elected as the Mayor of London

During the campaign, Johnson had confided to Brian Paddick he was unsure how he would maintain his lifestyle on the mayoral salary of £140,000 a year. He agreed to continue his Daily Telegraph column, thus earning a further £250,000 a year. His team believed this would cause controversy and made him promise to donate 20% of his Daily Telegraph salary to a charitable cause. Johnson resented this, and ultimately did not pay the full 20%. Controversy erupted when on the BBC's HARDtalk he referred to the £250,000 salary as ""chicken feed""; this was at the time approximately 10 times the average yearly wage for a British worker.[192][193]

Johnson at the opening of NASDAQ in 2009

During his first administration, Johnson was embroiled in several personal scandals. After moving to a new house in Islington, he built a shed without obtaining planning permission; after neighbours complained, he dismantled it. The press also accused him of having an affair with Helen Macintyre and of fathering her child, allegations that he did not deny.[196][197][198] Johnson was accused of warning Damian Green that police were planning to arrest him; Johnson denied the claims. He was accused of cronyism, in particular for appointing Veronica Wadley as the chair of London's Arts Council.[202][203] In the parliamentary expenses scandal, he was accused of excessive expenses claims for taxis. Johnson remained a popular figure in London with a strong celebrity status in the city.

Policies

The New Routemaster bus introduced by Johnson's administration

Johnson made no major changes to the mayoral system of the previous administration. However, he did reverse several other measures implemented by Livingstone: ending the city's oil deal with Venezuela, abolishing The Londoner newsletter, and scrapping the half-yearly inspections of black cabs, which was reinstated three years later. Abolishing the western wing of the congestion charging zone, he cancelled plans to increase the congestion charge for four-wheel-drive vehicles. He was subsequently accused of failing to publish an independent report on air pollution commissioned by the Greater London Authority, which revealed the city breached legal limits on nitrogen dioxide levels.[210][211]

Johnson retained Livingstone projects such as Crossrail and the 2012 Olympic Games, but was accused of trying to take credit for them. He introduced a public bicycle scheme that had been mooted by Livingstone's administration; colloquially known as ""Boris Bikes"", the part privately financed system was a significant financial loss but proved popular.[213] Despite Johnson's support of cycling, and his much-publicised identity as a cyclist, some cycling groups argued he had failed to make the city's roads safer for cyclists. As per his election pledge, he commissioned the development of the New Routemaster buses for central London. He also ordered the construction of a cable car system that crossed the River Thames between the Greenwich Peninsula and the Royal Docks.

Johnson implemented Livingstone's idea of a public bicycle system; the result was dubbed the ""Boris Bike"".

Johnson's first policy initiative was a ban on drinking alcohol on public transport.[219] He announced plans to extend pay-as-you-go Oyster cards to national rail services in London.[220] A pledge in Johnson's manifesto was to retain Tube ticket offices, in opposition to Livingstone's proposal to close up to 40.[221] On 2 July 2008, the Mayor's office announced the closure plan was to be abandoned.[222] On 21 November 2013, Transport for London announced that all London Underground ticket offices would close by 2015.[223] In financing these projects, Johnson's administration borrowed £100 million, while public transport fares were increased by 50%.

During his first term, Johnson was perceived as having moved leftward on certain issues, supporting the London Living Wage and endorsing an amnesty for illegal migrants. He tried placating critics who had deemed him a bigot by appearing at London's gay pride parade and praising ethnic minority newspapers. Johnson broke from the traditional protocol of those in public office not publicly commenting on other nations' elections by endorsing Barack Obama for the 2008 United States presidential election.[228][229]

Relations with the police, finance, and the media

Johnson's response to the 2011 London riots was criticised

Johnson appointed himself chair of the Metropolitan Police Authority (MPA), and in October 2008 successfully pushed for the resignation of Metropolitan Police Commissioner Ian Blair, after Blair was criticised for allegedly handing contracts to friends and for his handling of the death of Jean Charles de Menezes.[231][232] This earned Johnson respect among Conservatives, who interpreted it as his first act of strength. Johnson resigned as chairman of the MPA in January 2010, but throughout his mayoralty was highly supportive of the Metropolitan Police, particularly during the controversy surrounding the death of Ian Tomlinson. Overall crime in London fell during his administration, but his claim that serious youth crime had decreased proved to be false, and he acknowledged the error.[236] He was criticised for his response to the 2011 London riots.

Johnson lights the flame at the 2010 London Youth Games opening ceremony

Johnson championed London's financial sector and denounced what he saw as ""banker bashing"" following the financial crisis of 2007–08, condemning the anti-capitalist Occupy London movement that appeared in 2011. He collected donations from the city's wealthy for a charitable enterprise, the Mayor's Fund, which he had established to aid disadvantaged youths. It initially announced the fund would raise £100 million, but by 2010 it had only earnt £1.5 million. He also maintained extensive personal contacts throughout the British media, which resulted in widespread favourable press coverage of his administration. In turn he remained largely supportive of his friends in the media, including Rupert Murdoch, during the News International phone hacking scandal.

The formation of the Forensic Audit Panel was announced on 8 May 2008. The panel was tasked with monitoring and investigating financial management at the London Development Agency and the Greater London Authority.[243] Johnson's announcement was criticised by Labour for the perceived politicisation of this nominally independent panel.[244] The head of the panel, Patience Wheatcroft, was married to a Conservative councillor[245] and three of the four remaining panel members also had close links to the Conservatives.[246][247]

Re-election campaign

Up for re-election in 2012, Johnson again hired Crosby to orchestrate his campaign. Before the election, Johnson published Johnson's Life of London, a work of popular history that historian A. N. Wilson characterised as a ""coded plea"" for votes. Polls suggested that while Livingstone's approach to transport was preferred, voters in London placed greater trust in Johnson on crime and the economy. Johnson's campaign emphasised the accusation that Livingstone was guilty of tax evasion, for which Livingstone called Johnson a ""bare-faced liar"". Political scientist Andrew Crines believed that Livingstone's campaign focused on criticising Johnson rather than presenting an alternate and progressive vision of London's future. Johnson was re-elected.[253]

Second term: 2012–2016

After a successful bid under Livingstone in 2005, London hosted the 2012 Summer Olympics, with Johnson as board co-chair.[254] He improved transportation around London by making more tickets available and adding buses around the capital when thousands of spectators were temporary visitors.[255][256] Johnson was accused of covering up pollution ahead of the games by deploying dust suppressants to remove air particulates near monitoring stations.[210] In November 2013, Johnson announced major changes to the operation of the London Underground, including the extension of operating hours. All staffed ticket offices were replaced with automated ticketing systems.[257][258]

Johnson was close friends with American entrepreneur[259] and model Jennifer Arcuri, with The Sunday Times describing him as a regular visitor to her flat,[260] and implying they were in a sexual relationship.[261] Arcuri and her company, Innotech, were awarded substantial government grants, and Johnson intervened to allow her onto three trade mission trips.[262] The Sunday Times said in September 2019 that Johnson failed to declare his personal relationship as a conflict of interest.[263] The Greater London Authority referred the matter to the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) ""so it can assess whether or not it is necessary to investigate the former mayor of London for the criminal offence of misconduct in public office"", for the Mayor is also London's police and crime commissioner.[264] On 9 November 2019 it was revealed that the IOPC had decided to publish its report after the general election on 12 December.[265] The IOPC eventually issued its report in May 2020, concluding that, although there was no basis for any criminal charge, there was evidence that the close relationship between Johnson and Arcuri had influenced decisions, that Johnson should have declared an interest, and that his failure to do this could have breached the London Assembly's code of conduct.[266]

In 2015, Johnson criticised then-presidential candidate Donald Trump's false comments that there were no-go zones in London inaccessible for non-Muslims. Johnson said Trump was ""betraying a quite stupefying ignorance that makes him frankly unfit to hold the office of President of the United States"",[267] becoming the first senior politician in the UK to declare Trump unfit for office, but rejecting calls for him to be banned from the country.[268] In 2016, he said he was ""genuinely worried that [Trump] could become president"", telling ITV's Tom Bradby that being mistaken for Trump in New York was ""one of the worst moments"" of his life.[269]

Johnson did not run for a third mayoral and stepped down on 5 May 2016 following the election. A YouGov poll commissioned at the end of Johnson's term revealed that 52% of Londoners believed he did a ""good job"" while 29% believed he did a ""bad job"".[270]

Return to Parliament

Johnson initially said that he would not return to the House of Commons while mayor. After much media speculation, in August 2014 he sought selection as the Conservative candidate for the safe seat of Uxbridge and South Ruislip at the 2015 general election.[271][272][273] In the 2015 general election, Johnson was elected. There was speculation that he had returned to Parliament because he wanted to replace Cameron as Conservative leader and prime minister.[274]

Brexit campaign: 2015–2016

In February 2016, Johnson endorsed Vote Leave in the ""Out"" campaign for the 2016 European Union membership referendum.[275] Following this announcement, which was interpreted by financial markets as making Brexit more probable, the pound sterling slumped by nearly 2% against the US dollar, reaching its lowest level since March 2009.[276]

In April 2016, in response to a comment by President Barack Obama that Britain should remain in the European Union, Johnson wrote an ""ancestral dislike"" of Britain owing to his ""part-Kenyan"" background may have shaped Obama's views.[277] Several politicians condemned his comments as racist and unacceptable.[278][279][280] Conversely, former Conservative Party leader Iain Duncan Smith and UK Independence Party (UKIP) leader Nigel Farage defended them.[278][281]

Johnson supported Vote Leave's statement that the government was committed to Turkish accession to the EU. Vote Leave was accused of implying that 80 million Turks would come to the UK if it stayed in the EU. When interviewed in January 2019, he said he had not mentioned Turkey during the campaign.[282][283] In a televised debate on 22 June 2016, Johnson declared 23 June could be ""Britain's independence day"".[284] According to James Murdoch, Johnson did not believe the Brexit referendum would pass and when, during a meeting between him and other executives of Fox News, he was asked its potential result he replied ""We'll see"".[285]

Following the victory of the ""Leave"" campaign, Cameron resigned. Johnson was widely regarded as the front-runner to succeed him.[286][287] Johnson announced he would not stand in the Conservative leadership election.[288] Shortly before this, Michael Gove, hitherto a Johnson ally, concluded that Johnson ""cannot provide the leadership or build the team for the task ahead"".[289][290] The Daily Telegraph called Gove's comments ""the most spectacular political assassination in a generation"".[291] Johnson endorsed Andrea Leadsom's candidature, but she dropped out, leaving Theresa May to be elected uncontested.[292]

Foreign Secretary: 2016–2018

Official portrait of Johnson as Foreign Secretary

May appointed Johnson foreign secretary in July 2016.[293] Analysts saw the appointment as a tactic to weaken Johnson politically: the new positions of ""Brexit secretary"" and international trade secretary left the foreign secretary as a figurehead.[293][294] Johnson's appointment ensured he would often be out of the country and unable to mobilise backbenchers against her, while forcing him to take responsibility for problems caused by withdrawing from the EU.[295][296]

Some journalists and foreign politicians criticised Johnson's appointment because of his controversial statements about other countries.[297][298][299] His tenure attracted criticism from diplomats and foreign policy experts.[300][301] A number of diplomats, FCO staff and foreign ministers who worked with Johnson compared his leadership unfavourably to previous foreign secretaries for his perceived lack of conviction or substantive positions on foreign policy issues.[300][301] A senior official in Obama's government suggested Johnson's appointment would push the US further towards Germany at the expense of the Special Relationship with the UK.[302] On one occasion Egyptian president Abdel Fattah el-Sisi walked out of a meeting with Johnson after a meeting did not ""get beyond the pleasantries"".[300]

Johnson with US president Donald Trump in 2017 UNGA

Johnson's visit to Turkey in September 2016 was somewhat tense because he had won Douglas Murray's offensive poetry competition about the President of Turkey, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, four months earlier.[303] When questioned by a journalist whether he would apologise for the poem, Johnson dismissed the matter as ""trivia"".[304] Johnson pledged to help Turkey join the EU and expressed support for Erdogan's government.[305] Johnson described the Gülen movement as a ""cult"" and supported Turkey's post-coup purges.[306]

Johnson supported the Saudi Arabian–led intervention in Yemen and refused to block UK arms sales to Saudi Arabia.[307][308] In September 2016, human rights groups accused him of blocking the UN inquiry into Saudi war crimes in Yemen.[309] Given the UK-Saudi alliance, in December 2016, he attracted attention for commenting the Saudis were akin to the Iranians in ""puppeteering and playing proxy wars"".[310][311][312] In November 2017, Johnson told the Foreign Affairs Select Committee that Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe – a British-Iranian citizen imprisoned in Iran after being arrested for training citizen journalists and bloggers in a BBC World Service Trust project – had been ""simply teaching people journalism"". Facing criticism, Johnson stated he had been misquoted and that nothing he said had justified Zaghari-Ratcliffe's sentence.[313][314] In May 2018, Johnson backed[315][316] the Iran nuclear deal framework, despite Donald Trump's withdrawal.[317]

In April 2017, Johnson said that Gibraltar's sovereignty was ""not going to change"" after Brexit.[318] Johnson promised while in Northern Ireland that Brexit would leave the Irish border ""absolutely unchanged"".[319] Johnson visited Anguilla and Tortola in September 2017 to confirm the UK's commitment to helping restore British territories devastated by Hurricane Irma.[320] In September 2017, he was criticised for reciting lines from Rudyard Kipling's poem Mandalay while visiting a Myanmar temple; the British ambassador, who was with him, suggested it was ""not appropriate"".[321][322][323] In October 2017, he faced criticism for stating the Libyan city of Sirte could become an economic success like Dubai: ""all they have to do is clear the dead bodies away"".[324][325]

Initially favouring a less hostile approach to Russia,[326] Johnson soon backed a more aggressive policy.[327][328] Following the March 2018 poisoning of Sergei and Yulia Skripal in Salisbury, an act which the UK government blamed on Russia,[329][330] Johnson compared Vladimir Putin's hosting of the World Cup in Russia to Adolf Hitler's hosting of the Olympic Games in Berlin in 1936.[331] Russia's Foreign Ministry denounced Johnson's ""unacceptable and unworthy"" parallel towards Russia, a ""nation that lost millions of lives in fighting Nazism"".[332] Johnson described the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline from Russia to Germany as ""divisive"" and a ""threat"" that left Europe dependent on a ""malign Russia"" for its energy supplies.[333]

Johnson condemned the persecution of Rohingya Muslims in Myanmar,[334] comparing the situation with the displacement of Palestinians in 1948.[335] Johnson supported the Turkish invasion of northern Syria aimed at ousting the Syrian Kurds from Afrin.[336] He accused the UNHRC of focusing disproportionately on the Israeli–Palestinian conflict and Israel's occupation of the Palestinian territories.[337]

Johnson meeting with Iranian foreign minister Mohammad Javad Zarif in Tehran in December 2017

In a September 2017 op-ed, Johnson reiterated the UK would regain control of £350m a week after Brexit, suggesting it go to the National Health Service (NHS).[338] Cabinet colleagues subsequently criticised him for reviving the assertion.[339][340] Following the 2017 general election, Johnson denied media reports he intended to challenge May's leadership.[341] In a February 2018 letter to May, Johnson suggested that Northern Ireland may have to accept border controls after Brexit and that it would not seriously affect trade, having initially said a hard border would be unthinkable.[342] In June, he was reported as having said ""fuck business"" when asked about corporate concerns regarding a 'hard' Brexit.[343][344][345][346]

Johnson with former UK prime minister Gordon Brown in May 2018

Secret recordings obtained by BuzzFeed News in June 2018 revealed Johnson's dissatisfaction with Prime Minister Theresa May's negotiating style, accusing her of being too collaborative with the European Union in Brexit negotiations. Comparing May's approach to that of the US president Donald Trump – who at the time was engaged in a combative trade war with the EU because it raised tariffs on metal – Johnson said: ""Imagine Trump doing Brexit. He'd go in bloody hard ... There'd be all sorts of breakdowns, all sorts of chaos. Everyone would think he'd gone mad. But actually you might get somewhere."" He accused individuals of scaremongering over a Brexit ""meltdown"", saying ""No panic. Pro bono publico, no bloody panic. It's going to be all right in the end.""[347]

In April 2018, Johnson travelled to Italy to attend a party at the Palazzo Terranova, owned by the former KGB agent Alexander Lebedev and hosted by his son Evgeny. He travelled without security protection or other officials,[348] and did not document the trip, which led to accusations of Johnson having misled parliament.[349] In June 2023, it was revealed that Lord Simon McDonald, the most senior civil servant of his department, was not aware of the trip. Johnson stated that ""no government business was discussed"" at the event as far as he was aware.[350][351] Lebedev's villa was monitored by the Italian secret service at the time, who, according to a Channel 4 documentary, suspected it to be used for espionage activities.[352] Johnson granted a peerage to Evgeny in 2020, against the advice of the MI6, and met with criticism over potential security concerns.[353][354][355]

In July 2018, three days after the cabinet had its meeting to agree on a Brexit strategy,[356] Johnson, along with Brexit secretary David Davis,[357] resigned his post.[358]

Return to the backbenches: 2018–2019

Johnson returned to the role of a backbench MP. In July, he delivered a resignation speech, stating ""it is not too late to save Brexit"".[359] In January 2019, Johnson came under criticism for remarks he had made during the 2016 Leave campaign regarding the prospect of Turkish accession to the European Union; he denied making such remarks.[360] In March 2019, he was criticized for saying that expenditure on investigating historic allegations of child abuse was money ""spaffed up the wall"".[361][362]

Journalism

In July 2018, Johnson signed a 12‑month contract to write articles for the Telegraph Media Group.[363] The Advisory Committee on Business Appointments (ACOBA) reported that this was a breach of the Ministerial Code.[363][364] Johnson was ordered to apologise for failing to declare £50,000 of earnings. The Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards found the errors were not inadvertent, and that Johnson had failed on nine occasions to make declarations within the rules.[365]

In September 2018, Johnson wrote: ""We have opened ourselves to perpetual political blackmail. We have wrapped a suicide vest around the British constitution – and handed the detonator to Michel Barnier."" Senior Tories heavily criticised him, with Alan Duncan of the Foreign Office vowing to ensure the comments marked ""the political end of Boris Johnson"".[366][367] In April 2019, the Independent Press Standards Organisation ruled that a claim in a 6 January 2019 article in The Daily Telegraph, ""The British people won't be scared into backing a woeful Brexit deal nobody voted for"", authored by Johnson,[368] that a no-deal Brexit was ""by some margin preferred by the British public"" was false, and ""represented a failure to take care over the accuracy of the article in breach of Clause 1 (i)"" of its guidelines, and required that a correction be published.[369]

2019 Conservative Party leadership election

On 12 June 2019, Johnson launched his campaign for the Conservative Party leadership election, saying, ""we must leave the EU on 31 October.""[370] On the campaign trail, Johnson warned of ""catastrophic consequences for voter trust in politics"" if the government pushed the EU for further delays. He advocated removing the backstop from any Brexit deal. On 25 and 26 August, he announced plans to retain £7 or £9 billion of the £39 billion divorce payment the UK is due to transfer to the EU upon withdrawal.[371][372] Johnson initially pledged to cut income tax for earners of more than £50,000 but backed away from this plan in June 2019 after coming under criticism in a televised BBC debate.[373]

Johnson was elected leader with 92,153 votes (66%) to Hunt's 46,656 (34%).[374]

Premiership (2019–2022)

First term (July–December 2019)

On 24 July 2019, the day following Johnson's election as Conservative Party leader, Queen Elizabeth II accepted Theresa May's resignation and appointed Johnson as prime minister. This made Johnson the first prime minister to be born outside British territories.[375] Johnson appointed Dominic Cummings as his senior advisor.[376]

Brexit policy

Johnson signing the Brexit Withdrawal Agreement

In his first speech as PM, Johnson said that the United Kingdom would leave the European Union on 31 October 2019 with or without a deal, and promised to remove the Irish backstop from the withdrawal agreement.[377][378] Johnson declared his intention to re-open negotiations, but talks did not immediately resume as the EU refused to accept Johnson's condition that the backstop be removed.[379] On 28 August 2019, UK and EU negotiators agreed to resume regular meetings.[380]

Also on 28 August 2019, Johnson declared he had asked the Queen to prorogue Parliament from 10 September, reducing the time in which Parliament could block a no-deal Brexit and causing a political controversy.[381] The Queen at Privy Council approved prorogation later the same day, and it began on 10 September, scheduled to last until 14 October.[382] Some suggested[383] that this prorogation amounted to a self-coup, and on 31 August 2019, protests occurred throughout the United Kingdom.[384][385] By 2 September 2019, three separate court cases challenging Johnson's action were in progress or scheduled to take place,[386] and on 11 September, three Scottish judges ruled the prorogation of the UK Parliament to be unlawful.[387][388] On 12 September, Johnson denied lying to the Queen over suspension of the Parliament, while a Belfast Court rejected claims that his Brexit plans would have a negative impact on Northern Ireland's peace policy.[389] On 24 September, the Supreme Court ruled unanimously that Johnson's advice to prorogue Parliament was unlawful, and therefore the prorogation was rendered null.[390][391]

When Parliament resumed on 3 September 2019, Johnson indicated he would call a general election under the Fixed-term Parliaments Act after opposition and rebel Conservative MPs successfully voted against the government to take control of the order of business to prevent a no-deal exit.[392] Despite government opposition, the Benn Act, a bill to block a no-deal exit, passed the Commons on 4 September 2019, causing Johnson to propose a general election on 15 October.[393] His motion was unsuccessful as it failed to command the support of two-thirds of the House.[394]

In October 2019, following bilateral talks between Johnson and Taoiseach Leo Varadkar,[395] the UK and EU agreed to a revised deal, which replaced the backstop with a new Northern Ireland Protocol.[396]

First Cabinet

Johnson appointed his Cabinet on 24 July 2019,[397] dismissing 11 senior ministers and accepting the resignation of six others.[398][399] The mass dismissal was the most extensive postwar Cabinet reorganisation without a change in the ruling party.[400][401]

Among other appointments, Johnson made Dominic Raab the First Secretary of State and foreign secretary and appointed Sajid Javid and Priti Patel as the Chancellor of the Exchequer and Home Secretary, respectively.

Loss of working majority

On 3 September 2019, Phillip Lee crossed the floor to the Liberal Democrats following a disagreement with Johnson's Brexit policy. This left the government without a working majority in the House of Commons.[402] Later that day, 21 Conservative MPs had the party whip withdrawn for defying party orders and supporting an opposition motion.[403] (The whip was restored to 10 former Conservative ministers on 29 October.[404])

Johnson giving a speech in December 2019 after the 2019 general election

On 5 September 2019, Johnson's brother Jo Johnson resigned from the government and announced that he would step down as MP, describing his position as ""torn between family and national interest"".[405] Two days later, Amber Rudd resigned as Secretary of State for Work and Pensions and from the Conservative Party, describing the withdrawal of the party whip as an ""assault on decency and democracy"".[406]

2019 general election

In October 2019, Parliament was dissolved, and an election called for 12 December. The election resulted in the Conservative Party winning 43.6% of the vote and a parliamentary landslide majority of 80 seats.[407] A key slogan used in the Conservative campaign was ""Get Brexit Done"".[408]

Second term (December 2019 – September 2022)

Second Cabinet

Johnson reshuffled his cabinet in February 2020.[409] Five Cabinet ministers were sacked, including the Northern Ireland secretary Julian Smith, a decision that was criticised by several politicians and commentators following his success in restoring the Northern Ireland Executive devolved government.[410] Chancellor of the Exchequer Sajid Javid resigned from the Cabinet and was replaced by Rishi Sunak; Javid later returned to Johnson's Cabinet as Secretary of State for Health and Social Care in June 2021 following the resignation of Matt Hancock.[411]

Johnson reshuffled his cabinet again in September 2021. Changes included the dismissal of Education Secretary Gavin Williamson who had received significant criticism for his handling of disruption to education during the COVID-19 pandemic. Dominic Raab was moved from foreign secretary to deputy prime minister and justice secretary. Raab was replaced as foreign secretary by Liz Truss.[412][413]

COVID-19 pandemic

The COVID-19 pandemic emerged as a serious crisis within the first few months of Johnson's second term.[414] Johnson's non-attendance of five COBR briefings during the early months and the failure of the UK government to prepare for and control the outbreak has been criticised.[415][416][417] The UK was among the last major[clarification needed] European states to close schools, ban public events and order a lockdown.[418][419] This response is thought by some scientists to have contributed to the UK's high death toll from COVID-19, which as of January 2021 was among the highest in the world.[420][needs update]

Reuters reported that scientists were critical of Johnson both for acting too slowly to stop the spread of COVID-19 and for mishandling the government's response;[421] Politico quoted Chief Medical Officer Chris Whitty as saying that an earlier initial lockdown would have significantly lowered the death toll.[422] The BMJ published several editorials critical of the policies adopted during the country's public health response.[423][424] Johnson's public communication over the virus and the UK's test and trace system were also criticised.[421][425][426]

On 3 March 2020 Johnson claimed to have shaken hands with COVID-19 patients in hospital on the same day that SAGE had advised the government to warn the public not to shake hands and minimise physical contact,[427][428] though it was unclear whether the hospital he visited actually contained any coronavirus patients.[429] He continued to shake hands publicly in the following days.[430] On 23 March, a COVID-19 lockdown was imposed throughout the UK, except for a few limited purposes, backed up by new legal powers.[431]

Johnson giving a speech in April 2020 after recovering from COVID-19

On 27 March, it was announced that Johnson had tested positive for COVID-19.[432] On 5 April, he was admitted to a hospital.[433] The next day, he was moved to the hospital's intensive care unit.[434][435] Johnson left intensive care on 9 April,[436] and left hospital three days later to recuperate at Chequers.[437] After a fortnight at Chequers, he returned to Downing Street on 26 April.[438] Johnson later said that he had been given emergency oxygen while in intensive care, and that doctors had made preparations in case he died.[439]

A scandal in May 2020 involved Johnson's chief political advisor Dominic Cummings, who made a trip with his family to Durham during the March 2020 lockdown while experiencing COVID-19 symptoms. Both Cummings and Johnson rejected widespread calls that Cummings resign.[440][441][442] Johnson's defence of Cummings and his refusal to sack him caused a widespread backlash.[443] This resulted in a loss of confidence in the government and specifically its response to the pandemic, referred to as 'the Cummings effect' in The Lancet. Concerns were raised in the study that this could affect the public's compliance with pandemic restrictions.[444][445]

The Johnson ministry was accused of cronyism in their assignment of contracts related to the pandemic response. Procurement of government contracts for key COVID-19 supplies became less transparent as a result of emergency measures bypassing the usual competitive tendering process.[446][447] In October 2020 Johnson conceded that the UK's test and trace system and its specially developed contact tracing app, which had been criticised for their cost and operational issues, had caused ""frustrations"".[421][448][449]

Johnson hosts virtual G7 meeting in February 2021

Johnson reportedly resisted calls from SAGE and within the government to enact a second lockdown throughout September as COVID-19 infections rose.[450][451] In April 2021 Johnson denied allegations he had said he would rather ""let the bodies pile high in their thousands"" on 30 October 2020.[452][453][454] The government enacted a second national lockdown on 31 October.[455] Throughout December 2020 COVID-19 cases across the UK rose significantly, straining emergency services and hospitals.[456][457] In response, the government enacted further restrictions to large parts of southern and eastern England and on 21 December shortened a planned household mixing period over Christmas.[458]

Britain began its COVID-19 vaccination programme in December 2020.[459] Half of UK adults had received at least their first vaccine dose by 20 March 2021.[460] A third lockdown for the whole of England was introduced on 6 January 2021.[461] Record numbers of infections and daily deaths were recorded in the UK throughout January, and the government began exploring quarantine procedures on arrival.[462] Johnson said he was ""deeply sorry"" and ""take[s] full responsibility"" as the UK passed 100,000 deaths from COVID-19, the first European country to do so, on 26 January.[463]

Johnson with US president Joe Biden at the G7 summit in Cornwall, 10 June 2021

In July 2021 Johnson announced that most generalised public health restrictions in England would be lifted and replaced by recommendations. This took place despite an increase in cases driven by the Delta variant.[464][465] In September 2021 Johnson was pictured in a cabinet meeting, with ""at least 30 people crammed shoulder-to-shoulder"", without anyone wearing masks and with all windows apparently closed, contradicting government advice.[466] Johnson was also photographed without a face mask during a visit to a hospital in November.[467]

In December 2021 more stringent ""Plan B"" restrictions for England were put forward, a partial renewal of previous measures due to the increased incidence of the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant. These proposals included face coverings to be required in more public settings, guidance to work from home wherever possible, and requirements of COVID-19 passports to enter certain venues.[468] The government experienced the largest rebellion of Conservative MPs during Johnson's premiership, in opposition to these measures.[469][470]

Immigration

In 2019, Johnson promised to reduce net migration to the United Kingdom (the number of people immigrating minus the number emigrating) below 250,000 per year by the next election.[471] In 2021 net migration to the UK was 488,000,[472][473] up from 184,000 in 2019 before the COVID-19 pandemic.[474] Most of the migrants came from non-EU countries. As a result of Brexit, more EU nationals left the UK than arrived.[473]

In 2021, Johnson's government launched a scheme for Hongkongers following the Hong Kong national security law, with more than 200,000 Hong Kong residents immigrating to the UK.[475]

Long-term net migration to the UK reached a record high of 764,000 in 2022,[476] with immigration at 1.26 million and emigration at 493,000.[477]

Legislative agenda

At the State Opening of Parliament on 11 May 2021, a range of proposed laws were announced, including the Dissolution and Calling of Parliament Bill, which would restore the royal prerogative to dissolve Parliament; a Higher Education (Freedom of Speech) Bill to combat deplatforming at universities;[478] an Online Safety Bill that would impose a statutory duty of care on online companies and empower Ofcom to block particular websites;[479] and an Animal Welfare (Sentience) Bill that would legally recognise animal sentience. Further laws would introduce mandatory voter identification at general elections, reform the national immigration system, and implement a levelling up policy to reduce imbalances between areas.[478]

2021 Downing Street refurbishment controversy

In April 2021 Cummings alleged that Johnson had arranged for donors to ""secretly pay"" for renovations on the private residence at 11 Downing Street.[480] On 27 April Johnson asked the Cabinet Secretary, Simon Case, to hold a review about the refurbishment.[481] On 28 April, the Electoral Commission announced it had opened a formal investigation.[482][483] On the same day Johnson said that he had not broken any laws over the refurbishment and had met the requirements he was obliged to meet.[484] During Prime Minister's Questions, the leader of the opposition, Keir Starmer, asked: ""Who initially paid for the redecoration of his Downing Street flat?""; Johnson responded: ""I paid for Downing Street's refurbishment personally.""[485]

On 28 May Lord Geidt published a report on the allegations which concluded that Johnson did not breach the Ministerial Code and that no conflict, or reasonably perceived conflict, of interest arose. However, Lord Geidt expressed that it was ""unwise"" for Johnson to have proceeded without ""more rigorous regard for how this would be funded"".[486][487] The Electoral Commission reported on 9 December that it found that the Conservative Party had failed to follow the law in not accurately reporting donations to the party from Lord Brownlow and imposed a £17,800 fine on the party.[488][489] The Herald said the commission's report outlined how, in March, all the money paid by Brownlow and his company had been reimbursed, as had the payments made by the Conservative Party and Cabinet Office.[489] Downing Street had said at the time that the full cost of the works had been met personally by the prime minister.[489]

Owen Paterson controversy

In November 2021 Johnson backed a motion to block the suspension of Owen Paterson, a Conservative MP found to have abused his position by the independent standards commissioner after undertaking paid lobbying.[490] The motion called for the creation of a new Conservative-majority committee to examine reforms of the standards investigation process.[491] Many Conservative MPs refused to support the motion, and 13 defied a three-line whip to vote against it.[492] Following the announcement by opposition parties that they would boycott the new committee, and faced with a backlash in the media and from MPs of all parties, the government announced that a new vote would take place on whether Paterson should be suspended.[493] Paterson announced his resignation as an MP the same day.[494] A by-election in Paterson's former constituency of North Shropshire saw the Liberal Democrat candidate, Helen Morgan, overturn a Conservative majority of nearly 23,000,[495] the seventh largest swing in United Kingdom by-election history.[496]

Partygate scandal

Downing Street, where some of the gatherings took place [ 497 ]

In December 2021 reports emerged that social gatherings of government and Conservative Party staff in Downing Street had taken place ahead of Christmas 2020 against COVID-19 regulations. Johnson denied these allegations.[498][499] Following a leaked video showing Downing Street staff joking about a ""fictional party"", at a press conference rehearsal recorded days after one alleged party took place, Johnson apologised for the contents of the video and suggested he had been misled but had now ordered an inquiry.[500][501]

On 10 January 2022, ITV News reported that a planned party had taken place on 20 May 2020, during the first lockdown. ITV had obtained an email sent by principal private secretary Martin Reynolds to staff inviting them to ""socially distanced drinks"" in the garden of No. 10.[502] At the time, people outdoors were not allowed to meet more than one person from outside their household.[503] Two eyewitnesses later alleged that Johnson and Symonds attended, contradicting Johnson's insistence in December 2021 that there were ""no parties"".[504][502]

On 12 January 2022, Johnson apologised to MPs in the Commons for ""attending an event in the Downing Street garden during the first lockdown"",[505][506] stating he believed it was ""a work event"".[507] He said that MPs should await the outcome of the independent inquiry, led by senior civil servant Sue Gray, which he said ""will report as soon as possible"".[508] There were calls across the House for Johnson to resign.[508][509]

An image of Johnson at a social gathering, from Sue Gray's report into the partygate scandal.

On 19 January, Bury South MP Christian Wakeford defected from the Conservative Party to the Labour Party.[510] Conservative former minister David Davis called for Johnson to resign, quoting Leo Amery calling on Neville Chamberlain to resign during the Norway Debate in 1940, and saying: ""You have sat there too long for all the good you have done. In the name of God, go.""[511][512][513]

On 25 January, the Metropolitan Police's chief commander, Cressida Dick, announced that they were commencing investigations into the Downing Street Parties.[514] An abbreviated version of the Sue Gray report into the controversy was released on 31 January, where Gray concluded there was a ""failure of leadership"" over the events that she had examined. The release of the full report was delayed pending the Metropolitan Police's investigation.[515]

In April 2022, Johnson was issued a fixed penalty notice as police determined that he committed a criminal offence by breaching the COVID-19 lockdown regulations.[516][517] Johnson therefore became the first prime minister in British history to have been sanctioned for breaking the law while in office.[518]

According to Downing Street insiders, Johnson was involved in instigating a party on the occasion of Lee Cain leaving Number 10. What had begun as press office drinks became a party after Johnson arrived, gave a speech and poured drinks for staff. Labour's deputy leader, Angela Rayner said, ""If the latest reports are true, it would mean that not only did the prime minister attend parties, but he had a hand in instigating at least one of them. He has deliberately misled the British people at every turn. The prime minister has demeaned his office.""[519][520][521][522] On 21 April, MPs voted to refer Johnson to the Parliamentary Privileges Committee to investigate whether he knowingly misled Parliament.[523] Steve Baker said Johnson's ""marvellous contrition... only lasted as long as it took to get out of the headmaster's study"".[524]

Following the May 2022 local elections, many leading Conservatives in areas where the Conservatives had done badly blamed Johnson and calling on Johnson to resign.[525] On 6 June, Graham Brady announced that the threshold for a vote on Johnson's leadership had been passed; the vote was scheduled for later that same day.[526]

On 3 March 2023, an interim report from the Commons Select Committee of Privileges said there was evidence that ""strongly suggests"" breaches of coronavirus regulations would have been ""obvious"" to Johnson.[527] The report also said ""There is evidence that those who were advising Mr Johnson about what to say to the press and in the House were themselves struggling to contend that some gatherings were within the rules"".[527] Johnson said none of the evidence showed he ""knowingly"" misled Parliament.[527] The report stated that the Commons may have been misled on multiple occasions and Johnson ""did not correct the statements [at the] earliest opportunity"".[527] The committee also stated that Johnson had ""personal knowledge"" over lockdown gatherings in No 10, which he could have disclosed.[527]

Starmer slur controversy

Johnson with Keir Starmer and former prime minister Theresa May, 14 November 2021

While speaking in the House of Commons in January 2022, Johnson falsely blamed Starmer for the non-prosecution of the serial sex offender Jimmy Savile when Starmer was Director of Public Prosecutions in the Crown Prosecution Service. Starmer was DPP in the years immediately prior to Savile's death but there is no evidence he was involved in the decision to not have him prosecuted.[528] A few days later, Johnson defended his comments but conceded that Starmer ""had nothing to do personally with those decisions"" by the CPS not to investigate Savile.[529]

Vote of confidence

In the week prior to and throughout the Platinum Jubilee of Elizabeth II in June 2022, it had been speculated that a vote of confidence in Johnson's leadership of the Conservative Party might soon occur.[530][531] On 6 June 2022, the Conservative Party announced that Johnson would face a vote of confidence in his leadership of the party, after at least 54 Conservative MPs wrote no-confidence letters to Sir Graham Brady, the chairman of the 1922 Committee. Johnson won the vote, with 211 in favour and 148 against.[532][533] The number of rebel MPs was larger than had been expected.[533] The result was described by Keir Starmer as the ""beginning of the end"" for Johnson's premiership.[534]

June 2022 by-elections

Following heavy Conservative defeats in the 23 June 2022 by-elections in Wakefield and Tiverton and Honiton, former party leader Michael Howard called for Johnson to resign, saying: ""[Mr Johnson's] biggest asset has always been his ability to win votes but I'm afraid yesterday's results make it clear that he no longer has that ability.""[535][536]

Oliver Dowden, the Co-Chairman of the Conservative Party, resigned saying: ""somebody must take responsibility"".[537] Johnson announced that he had no intention of changing or resigning; senior Conservatives accused him of increasingly ""delusional"" behaviour.[538][539] On 26 June 2022 Johnson said: ""At the moment I'm thinking actively about the third term and what could happen then, but I will review that when I get to it."" He also claimed that he intended to stay as prime minister until the mid-2030s, although Number 10 later said that he had been joking.[540]

Pincher scandal

Government Deputy Chief Whip Chris Pincher resigned on 30 June 2022, saying he had ""drunk far too much"" the night before at the Carlton Club in St James's, London, and having ""embarrassed myself and other people"".[541] It was later alleged that he sexually assaulted two men,[542] and he was suspended as an MP.[543] On 3 July 2022 six new allegations against Pincher emerged, involving behaviour over a decade.[544]

Johnson allegedly referred to Pincher as ""handsy"" and Cummings said Johnson joked about him being ""Pincher by name, pincher by nature"" in 2020, leading to calls for Johnson to explain how much he knew about Pincher's behaviour.[545] Ministers initially said that Johnson was unaware of any specific complaints against Pincher when he was appointed as deputy chief whip. The BBC then reported, however, that an official complaint and subsequent investigation into Pincher, while he was at the Foreign Office (July 2019 to February 2020), had confirmed his misconduct, and that Johnson had been made aware at that time.[546] Sir Simon McDonald, former Permanent Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, later said that the prime minister had been briefed ""in person"" about Pincher.[547][548]

Mass resignations

On 5 July 2022, Sunak and Javid resigned within minutes of each other,[549] followed over the next 24 hours by 11 other ministers, as well as Conservative MPs from parliamentary private secretary and other Government positions;[550] other backbenchers also withdrew their support for Johnson. Many of the MPs stated that the Pincher affair had led them to change their minds on the suitability of Johnson to be prime minister.[551] It was reported on 6 July that Johnson could face another confidence vote, with members of the 1922 Committee considering changing the rules as soon as that evening to allow this to happen.[552] By 6 July, there had been a total of 31 resignations.[553] As of May 2022, the government comprised 122 ministers.[554]

Announcement of resignation

By the morning of 7 July, the newly installed Chancellor of the Exchequer, Nadhim Zahawi, publicly stated his belief that Johnson should resign. Within hours, the BBC and other media reported Johnson's intention to resign. Johnson announced his resignation at 12.30 pm.[555][556][557]

I know that there will be many who are relieved, but perhaps quite a few who will be disappointed. And I want you to know how sad I am to give up the best job in the world – but them's the breaks.

Upon reports of his resignation, the pound sterling temporarily strengthened in value, and UK stocks rose.[558] He remained as prime minister until September, while the Conservative Party chose a new leader.[559] On 5 September 2022, it was announced that Liz Truss had won the Conservative leadership election. She became prime minister the next day.[560][561] During his farewell speech outside 10 Downing Street on 6 September 2022, Johnson referred to the Roman statesman Cincinnatus. Some commentators noted that, while, as Johnson said, Cincinnatus returned to his plough, he was also later recalled to power.[562]

Environmental policies

In November 2020 Johnson announced a 10-point plan for a ""green industrial revolution"", to include ending the sale of petrol and diesel cars and vans by 2030,[d] quadrupling the amount of offshore wind power capacity within a decade, funding emissions-cutting proposals, and spurning a proposed green post-COVID-19 recovery.[564] In 2021 the Johnson government announced plans to cut carbon emissions by 78% by 2035.[565]

Johnson announced that the UK would join the Global Methane Pledge to cut methane emissions by 30% by 2030 at the COP26 summit, which the UK hosted.[566][567] Before the summit, representatives of Greenpeace and Friends of the Earth criticised Johnson's comments on plans to introduce ""enforceable limits"" on carbon emissions for other countries, which they accused of being unsubstantive,[568] and his government faced criticism from environmental groups for cutting taxes on domestic air travel, given the environmental impact of aviation.[569]

In April 2022, Johnson announced that eight more nuclear reactors would be built on existing nuclear power plant sites and called for an expansion in wind energy.[570] Under these plans, up to 95% of the UK's electricity could come from low-carbon power sources by 2030.[571]

Foreign policy

Johnson supported the European Union–Mercosur Free Trade Agreement,[572] which would form one of the world's largest free trade areas.[573] Johnson's government placed importance on the ""Special Relationship"" with the United States.[574][575] In 2022, his government introduced an asylum deal whereby people entering the UK illegally would be sent to Rwanda.[576]

Hong Kong and China

Johnson said in July 2019 that his government would be very ""pro-China"" in an interview with the Hong Kong broadcaster Phoenix TV. He voiced support for Chinese president Xi Jinping's infrastructure investment effort, the Belt and Road Initiative, and promised to keep the United Kingdom ""the most open economy in Europe"" for Chinese investment.[577]

In June 2020 Johnson announced that if China were to continue pursuing the Hong Kong national security law, the UK would offer 350,000 Hong Kong residents who are British National (Overseas) passport holders, and 2.6 million other eligible individuals, the chance to move to the UK.[578] China accused the UK of interfering in its internal affairs.[579]

Johnson declined to describe the Chinese government's treatment of the Uyghur people as ""genocide"", despite use of the term by the United States.[580] Johnson's government argued that genocide should be decided by the International Criminal Court.[581] Nevertheless, he called what is happening to the Uyghurs in Xinjiang as ""utterly abhorrent"".[580]

The UK joined the AUKUS defence pact with the United States and Australia in September 2021. The pact was denounced by China[582] and caused a French backlash, as it usurped existing plans for Australia to procure French submarines.[583]

Afghanistan

On 8 July 2021 the day after saying he was ""apprehensive"" about the future of Afghanistan following what was then the impending withdrawal of US troops, while announcing the near completion of British troop withdrawal from Afghanistan, Johnson expressed the view that there was ""no military path to victory for the Taliban"".[584][585] Following the fall of Kabul to the Taliban, he blamed the United States for the crisis,[586][587] saying that NATO alliance members ""could not continue this US-led mission, a mission conceived and executed in support of America, without American logistics, without US air power and without American might"".[588]

UK–EU trade negotiation

Following the formal withdrawal from the European Union in January 2020, Johnson's government entered trade negotiations with the EU.[589] Fisheries was a major topic of the negotiations.[589][590] On 16 October 2020 Johnson said that the UK ""must get ready"" for no trade deal with the EU.[591] It was announced on 24 December 2020[592] that the EU–UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement had been reached; it came into force formally on 1 May. A fisheries dispute between the UK and France occurred shortly afterwards. Introduction of new UK border checks were delayed until 2022 to minimise the disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.[589]

In May 2022, Johnson readied a draft that would unilaterally change parts of the Northern Ireland Protocol, citing issues with medical supplies and cuts in VAT. One of the thornier points of contention involves safety regulations for food and plants, where the British government is opposed to a closer alignment with existing EU regulations. The EU rebuffed the idea of changing the text of the treaty to accommodate the British. A unilateral override by the UK would be tantamount to a breach of the agreement. As Johnson sought a more conciliatory tone, sources within the government began to stress that the draft is designed to be an ""insurance policy"" and would take years to become law.[593]

Russia and Ukraine

In November 2021 Johnson warned that the European Union faces ""a choice"" between ""sticking up for Ukraine"" and approving the Nord Stream 2 natural gas pipeline from Russia to Europe.[594]

During the prelude to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Johnson's government warned the Russian Government not to invade Donbas.[595][596][597] Johnson and Vladimir Putin agreed in a phone call to work towards a ""peaceful resolution"".[598] On 1 February 2022, Johnson arrived in Kyiv on a diplomatic visit.[599] He called the presence of the Russian Armed Forces near the Russia–Ukraine border ""the biggest security crisis that Europe has faced for decades"".[600] The Kremlin denied that it wanted to attack Ukraine.[600] On 20 February 2022, Johnson warned that Russia is planning the ""biggest war in Europe since 1945"" as Putin intends to invade and encircle Kyiv.[601] On 21 February 2022, Johnson condemned Russia's diplomatic recognition of two self-proclaimed republics in Donbas.[602]

On 24 February 2022, Johnson condemned the Russian invasion of Ukraine, and ensured the UK joined in international sanctions on Russian banks and oligarchs.[603] He later announced the UK would phase out Russian oil by the end of 2022.[604]

On 9 April 2022, Johnson travelled to Kyiv and met the President of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelenskyy.[605] On 16 April 2022, Russia's Ministry for Foreign Affairs banned Johnson and a number of senior British politicians from visiting Russia, saying that Britain aimed to isolate Russia politically and supply ""the Kyiv regime with lethal weapons and coordinating similar efforts on the part of NATO"".[606]

Within Ukraine, Johnson is praised by many as a supporter of anti-Russian sanctions and military aid for Ukraine.[607] On 3 May, Johnson virtually addressed the Ukrainian Parliament, becoming the first world leader to speak in Ukraine since the invasion. He pledged an extra £300m in military aid to Ukraine, praised Ukraine's resistance to Russia as its ""finest hour"" and said that the West had been ""too slow to grasp what was actually happening"" prior to Russia's invasion.[608][609] In July 2022, Johnson warned that it would be a mistake to cease fire and freeze the conflict.[610] In August 2022, Johnson blamed Vladimir Putin for the emerging global energy crisis.[611]

Post-premiership (2022–present)

After stepping down, Johnson reverted to being a backbench MP.[612][613] Following the death of Queen Elizabeth II, Johnson took part in Charles III's Accession Council.[614][615][616]

After Liz Truss announced her resignation as Conservative Party leader on 20 October 2022, Johnson received more than the 100 MPs' nominations required to stand in the leadership election,[617] but soon announced that he would not stand.[618][619][620]

In May 2023, Johnson was referred to the police by the Cabinet Office regarding previously unknown potential breaches of COVID regulations between June 2020 and May 2021,[621] to which Johnson's office issued a statement criticising the ""unfounded suggestions"" which ""has all the hallmarks of yet another politically motivated stitch-up"".[621]

On 9 June 2023, the publication of his 2022 Prime Minister's Resignation Honours led to a public feud with Sunak.[622][623] Johnson supporter Nadine Dorries announced that she was resigning as an MP due to not being included as a peer on the honours list.[624] The same day, after receiving a confidential report from a committee of the House of Commons that was looking into whether he had lied to Parliament over lockdown-breaking parties, Johnson announced his resignation as MP.[625] His resignation statement said he is ""not alone in thinking that there is a witch-hunt under way, to take revenge for Brexit and ultimately to reverse the 2016 referendum result"".[626]

On 15 June, the Commons Privileges Committee published their report, which concluded that Johnson lied to and deliberately misled the House of Commons over Partygate, misled the Committee themselves during the hearing, and acted in contempt of the Committee itself through a ""campaign of abuse and intimidation"".[627] The report noted that had Johnson still been an MP, the Committee would have recommended he be suspended from Parliament for 90 days.[628][629] The contents of the report represented a recommendation to the House of Commons,[630] which accepted the report by 354 votes to seven.[631][632]

On 16 June, Johnson was unveiled as a new columnist for the Daily Mail. The news website Politico Europe reported that Johnson would be paid a ""very-high six-figure sum"".[633][634] Johnson reportedly informed the Advisory Committee on Business Appointments half an hour before the columnist assignment was publicly announced. The committee ruled that Johnson committed a ""clear breach"" of the rules since he had not sought its advice on the matter within an appropriate timeframe.[635][636]

In October 2023, Johnson announced he would join the television channel GB News as a commentator and programme maker for the next general election and US presidential election.[637][638]

Johnson condemned Hamas' attack on Israel, saying ""there can be no moral equivalence between the terrorism of Hamas and the actions of the Israeli Defense Forces"". He rejected calls for a ceasefire in the Gaza Strip during the Israel–Hamas war, and criticised pro-Palestinian protests in the UK.[639] On 5 November 2023, Johnson visited Israel to express solidarity.[640]

In February 2024, Johnson had a private meeting with the president of Venezuela, Nicolás Maduro.[641] In March 2024, The Times reported that Johnson is expected to campaign for the Conservatives in the next General Election.[642]

On 2 May 2024 Johnson was turned away from his polling station for the Thames Valley Police and Crime Commissioner, after forgetting to bring valid photographic identification, a requirement of the Elections Act, which Johnson introduced while in office. When he arrived he had nothing to prove his identity except the sleeve of his copy of Prospect magazine, on which his name and address had been printed. He said that when he returned a few minutes later, with his driving licence, he was then able to vote.[643] During the 2024 general election, Johnson campaigned for the Conservatives, who lost the election in a landslide to Labour.[644]

Johnson's memoirs Unleashed were released in October 2024.[645][646][647]

Political positions and ideology

[I am] free-market, tolerant, broadly libertarian (though perhaps not ultra-libertarian), inclined to see the merit of traditions, anti-regulation, pro-immigrant, pro-standing on your own two feet, pro-alcohol, pro-hunting, pro-motorist and ready to defend to the death the right of Glenn Hoddle to believe in reincarnation. — Boris Johnson, 2011

Ideologically, Johnson has been described as a ""One-Nation Tory"".[648][649] Political scientists have described Johnson's political positions as ambiguous and contradictory, encompassing nativist, authoritarian and free market tendencies on the one hand, and one-nation liberal conservatism on the other.[650] Some scholars have questioned Johnson's commitment to one-nation conservativism, instead characterising his ideology as flexible and populist.[651][652] Purnell stated that Johnson regularly changed his opinion on political issues, commenting on what she perceived to be ""an ideological emptiness beneath the staunch Tory exterior"".

During his tenure as mayor, Johnson gained a reputation as ""a liberal, centre-ground politician"", according to Business Insider.[654] In 2012, the political scientist Tony Travers described Johnson as ""a fairly classic—that is, small-state—mildly eurosceptic Conservative"" who also embraced ""modern social liberalism"".[655] The Guardian stated that while mayor, Johnson blended economic and social liberalism,[656] with The Economist saying that in doing so Johnson ""transcends his Tory identity"" and adopts a more libertarian perspective.[657] According to political scientist Richard Hayton, Johnson's premiership was about Brexit, which served as a ""national cause"". Johnson evoked the discourse of popular sovereignty and anti-establishment populism to portray Parliament as seeking to ""sabotage"" Brexit, and in doing so, presented himself ""as the true representative of 'the people'"".[650][658]

Scholars of comparative politics have drawn comparisons between Johnson and other populist leaders such as Donald Trump and Viktor Orban.[658] Some commentators have likened Johnson's political style to Trumpism,[659][660][661] although others have argued that Johnson's stance on matters such as social policy, immigration and free trade is liberal.[662] Johnson biographer Gimson wrote that Johnson is economically and socially ""a genuine liberal"", although he retains a ""Tory element"" through his ""love of existing institutions, and a recognition of the inevitability of hierarchy"". In 2019, reacting to reports in The Sun, that Johnson had told cabinet colleagues he was ""basically a Brexity Hezza"", former deputy leader of the Conservative Party Michael Heseltine wrote: ""I fear that any traces of liberal conservatism that still exist within the prime minister have long since been captured by the rightwing, foreigner-bashing, inward-looking view of the world that has come to characterise his fellow Brexiters.""[664]

Environment

Johnson spoke about climate action at the COP26 climate summit in Glasgow on 1 November 2021

Johnson expressed climate sceptical views in several columns,[665][666][667] conflating the distinction between weather and climate and highlighting a factually incorrect claim by weather forecaster and conspiracy theorist Piers Corbyn that reduced solar activity could lead to a ""mini-Ice Age"".[668][667]

Bloomberg News suggested that Johnson's interest in climate change increased after becoming prime minister, and suggested this could have been influenced by his wife Carrie Symonds and father Stanley Johnson, who are both environmental campaigners.[669]

In 2019 and 2020 Johnson expressed support for the UK to have ""net-zero"" greenhouse gas emissions by 2050[670] and spoke about increasing ambition for mitigating climate change through carbon capture and storage[671] and a renewable energy transition.[672] During the 2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference, Johnson called for greater efforts towards climate change mitigation,[673] and welcomed the prospect of coal phase-out.[674]

It was reported in 2022 that Johnson was convinced of the scientific consensus on climate change following a briefing by the chief scientist of the Met Office in January 2020, and subsequently made the issue a priority for his government.[665]

According to TheyWorkForYou as of 2022 , Johnson has ""generally voted against"" what it described as ""key measures to prevent climate change""[clarification needed] while an MP,[675] and other sources confirm this.[668][666][needs update]

Immigration and the European Union

Johnson with EU Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker, 16 September 2019

Purnell believed it was the influence of Johnson's maternal family that led to him developing ""a genuine abhorrence of racial discrimination"". In 2003, Johnson said, ""I am not by any means an ultra-Eurosceptic. In some ways, I am a bit of a fan of the European Union. If we did not have one, we would invent something like it.""[677] As mayor, Johnson was known as a supporter of immigration.[677] From 2009, he advocated a referendum on Britain's EU membership.[677][678][679]

In 2018, during Brexit negotiations, Johnson called for Britain to leave the Single Market[677] and advocated a more liberal approach to immigration than that of Prime Minister May.[680] He stated many people believed that Britain's EU membership had led to the suppression of British wages and said the EU was intent on creating a ""superstate"" that would seek to rob Britain of its sovereignty.[677] In 2019, Johnson said he would take Britain out of the EU on 31 October whether there was a trade deal in place or not.[681] Johnson also stated his opposition to a referendum on the Brexit withdrawal agreement.[682]

On 19 August 2019, Johnson wrote a letter to the EU asking for the removal of the ""backstop"" accord. The president of the European Council, Donald Tusk, rejected the proposal.[683] On 26 August 2019, Johnson said that Britain would not pay £39 billion for the withdrawal agreement were the UK to leave without a deal. The European Parliament Brexit coordinator Guy Verhofstadt said there would be no further negotiation unless the UK agreed to pay the entire sum.[684][needs update]

Unionism and devolution

Johnson described himself as a ""fervent and passionate unionist"".[685] He proposed building an Irish Sea Bridge, but he later scrapped this initiative.[686]

The devolved administrations have criticised the Internal Market Bill for its re-centralisation of control over commerce.[687]

Public image

Johnson has said that ""humour is a utensil that you can use to sugar the pill and to get important points across"". He is said to have a genuine desire to be liked. Johnson has been described as having a light-hearted and charming persona; many biographers and commentators suggest he has put significant effort into developing this version of himself. He has also been described as heavily focused on his own interests, with an often vitriolic or irresponsible way of conducting himself in private.

Johnson has been described as a divisive, controversial figure in British politics.[703][704][705] Supporters have praised him as witty and entertaining. Johnson has been accused of lying or making misleading statements throughout his career,[707] and has been compared to US president Donald Trump.[708][709][710][711] He has been considered a figure with broad appeal outside of the usual Conservative support base. Johnson's premiership has been described by historians as the most controversial and scandal-affected since that of David Lloyd George about a century earlier.[713]

Personal life

Since Johnson was born in New York City to British parents, he held British-American dual citizenship. In 2015, he agreed to pay capital gains tax to the US tax authorities on a property that he inherited in the UK.[714][715][716] He renounced his US citizenship the following year.[717][718][719] Johnson has knowledge of French, Italian, German, Spanish, Latin and Ancient Greek,[720] frequently making classical allusions in his newspaper columns and his speeches.

Sonia Purnell wrote in 2011 that Johnson was a ""highly evasive figure"" when it came to his personal life, who remained detached from others and who had few intimate friends. Among friends and family, Johnson is more commonly known as Al (short for his forename Alexander), rather than Boris.

In 2007, Johnson said he had smoked cannabis before he went to university.[724] He has also said he had used cocaine. Johnson partakes in cycling, tennis and pilates, and returned to road running in 2023.[726] He was considered obese in 2018 and overweight in 2020, and has spoken of making efforts to lose weight.[727][728]

Johnson previously owned a £1.3 million buy-to-let townhouse in Camberwell, South London. According to HM Land Registry documents, he bought the four-bedroom property with his then-girlfriend Carrie Symonds in July 2019. The register of MPs' interests states that Johnson had a rental income of at least £10,000 a year.[729] In 2023, Johnson and Symonds bought Brightwell Manor in Brightwell-cum-Sotwell, Oxfordshire.[730]

Religion

Johnson was baptised Catholic and later confirmed in the Church of England, but has said that his faith ""comes and goes""[731] and that he is not a serious practising Christian.[732] In 2020 his son Wilfred was baptised Catholic.[733] Johnson and Symonds married in a Catholic ceremony at Westminster Cathedral on 29 May 2021.[734] Since he was baptised Catholic, but his previous weddings were not conferred by the Catholic Church, the Catholic Church considered them putatively invalid.[735][736]

Johnson holds ancient Greek statesman Pericles as a personal hero.[737][738] According to Johnson's biographer, Andrew Gimson, regarding ancient Greek and Roman polytheism: ""it is clear that [Johnson] is inspired by the Romans, and even more by the Greeks, and repelled by the early Christians"".[739] Johnson views secular humanism positively and sees it as owing more to the classical world than to Christian thinking.[740] In 2021 Johnson was asked if he held pre-Christian beliefs, which he denied, saying, ""Christianity is a superb ethical system and I would count myself as a kind of very, very bad Christian... Christianity makes a lot of sense to me.""[741]

Relationships

In 1987, Johnson married Allegra Mostyn-Owen, daughter of the art historian William Mostyn-Owen and Italian writer Gaia Servadio.[745] The couple's marriage ended in divorce or annulment in 1993[e] and 12 days later Johnson married Marina Wheeler, a barrister, daughter of journalist Charles Wheeler.[749] Five weeks later, their first child was born.[751] They have four children: Lara, Milo, Cassia and Theodore.[752]

Between 2000 and 2004, Johnson had an affair with Spectator columnist Petronella Wyatt when he was its editor, resulting in a terminated pregnancy and a miscarriage. In April 2006, the News of the World alleged that Johnson was having an affair with Guardian journalist Anna Fazackerley. The pair did not comment; shortly afterward, Johnson employed Fazackerley.[167]

In 2009, Johnson fathered a daughter with Helen Macintyre, an arts consultant.[198][753][754]

In September 2018, Johnson and Wheeler issued a statement confirming that they had separated months earlier;[755] they divorced in 2020.[756] Jennifer Arcuri said that she had an affair with Johnson from 2012 to 2016.[757][758]

In 2019, Johnson was living with Carrie Symonds, the daughter of Matthew Symonds, co-founder of The Independent newspaper.[759] Johnson and Symonds became engaged in late 2019[760] and their son, Wilfred,[761] was born in April 2020.[76"

Boris Johnson (born June 19, 1964, New York City, New York, U.S.) is an American-born British journalist and Conservative Party politician who became prime minister of the United Kingdom in July 2019. He left office in September 2022 after being forced by scandal to resign. Earlier he served as the second elected mayor of London (2008–16) and as secretary of state for foreign affairs (2016–18) under Prime Minister Theresa May.

Election to Parliament In 1997 Johnson was selected as the Conservative candidate for Clwyd South in the House of Commons, but he lost decisively to the Labour Party incumbent Martyn Jones. Soon after, Johnson began appearing on a variety of television shows, beginning in 1998 with the BBC talk program Have I Got News for You. His bumbling demeanour and occasionally irreverent remarks made him a perennial favourite on British talk shows. Johnson again stood for Parliament in 2001, this time winning the contest in the Henley-on-Thames constituency. Though he continued to appear frequently on British television programs and became one of the country’s most-recognized politicians, Johnson’s political rise was threatened on a number of occasions. He was forced to apologize to the city of Liverpool after the publication of an insensitive editorial in The Spectator, and in 2004 he was dismissed from his position as shadow arts minister after rumours surfaced of an affair between Johnson and a journalist. Despite such public rebukes, Johnson was reelected to his parliamentary seat in 2005.

Mayor of London Johnson entered into the London mayoral election in July 2007, challenging Labour incumbent Ken Livingstone. During the tightly contested election, he overcame perceptions that he was a gaffe-prone and insubstantial politician by focusing on issues of crime and transportation. On May 1, 2008, Johnson won a narrow victory, seen by many as a repudiation of the national Labour government led by Gordon Brown. Early the following month, Johnson fulfilled a campaign promise by stepping down as MP. In 2012 Johnson was reelected mayor, besting Livingstone again. His win was one of the few bright spots for the Conservative Party in the midterm local elections in which it lost more than 800 seats in England, Scotland, and Wales. While pursuing his political career, Johnson continued to write. His output as an author included Lend Me Your Ears (2003), a collection of essays; Seventy-two Virgins (2004), a novel; and The Dream of Rome (2006), a historical survey of the Roman Empire. In 2014 he added The Churchill Factor: How One Man Made History, which was described by one reviewer as a “breathless romp through the life and times” of Winston Churchill.

Return to Parliament, the Brexit referendum, and failed pursuit of the Conservative leadership Johnson returned to Parliament in 2015, winning the west London seat of Uxbridge and South Ruislip, in an election that saw the Conservative Party capture its first clear majority since the 1990s. He retained his post as mayor of London, and the victory fueled speculation that he would eventually challenge Prime Minister David Cameron for leadership of the Conservative Party. Some critics, however, charged that Johnson’s personal political ambitions led him to be less interested and less involved in his job as mayor than he was in self-promotion. Even before leaving the office of mayor—having chosen not to run for reelection in 2016—Johnson became the leading spokesman for the “Leave” campaign in the run-up to the June 23, 2016, national referendum on whether the United Kingdom should remain a member of the European Union. In that capacity, he faced off with Cameron, who was the country’s most prominent proponent of Britain remaining in the EU, and came under criticism for equating the EU’s efforts to unify Europe with those undertaken by Napoleon I and Adolf Hitler. Get Unlimited Access Try Britannica Premium for free and discover more. Subscribe When all of the votes were counted in the referendum, some 52 percent of those who went to the polls had opted for Britain to leave the EU, prompting Cameron to announce his imminent resignation as prime minister. He said that his successor should oversee the negotiations with the EU over Britain’s withdrawal and that he would step down before the Conservative Party conference in October 2016. Many observers believed that the path now had been laid for Johnson’s ascent to the party leadership and the premiership. In the morning at the end of June when he was set to officially announce his candidacy, however, Johnson was deserted by his key ally and prospective campaign chairman, Michael Gove, the justice secretary. Gove, who had worked alongside Johnson on the “Leave” campaign, concluded that Johnson could not “provide the leadership or build the team for the task ahead” and, instead of backing Johnson’s candidacy, announced his own. The British media were quick to see betrayals of Shakespearean proportions in the political drama involving Cameron, Johnson, and Gove, whose families had been close and who had moved up the ranks of the Conservative Party together. When he left, Gove took several of Johnson’s key lieutenants with him, and Johnson, seemingly concluding that he no longer had enough support in the party to win its leadership, quickly withdrew his candidacy.

Tenure as foreign secretary When Theresa May became Conservative Party leader and prime minister, she named Johnson her foreign secretary. Johnson maintained his seat in the House of Commons in the snap election called by May for June 2017, and he remained foreign secretary when May reshuffled her cabinet after the Conservatives lost their legislative majority in that election and formed a minority government. In April 2018 Johnson defended May’s decision to join the United States and France in the strategic air strikes that were undertaken against the regime of Syrian Pres. Bashar al-Assad in response to evidence that it had again used chemical weapons on its own people. Opposition parties were critical of the May government’s use of force without having first sought approval from Parliament. Johnson himself was taken to task in some quarters for statements he had made regarding an incident in March 2018 in which a former Russian intelligence officer who had acted as a double agent for Britain was found unconscious with his daughter in Salisbury, England. Investigators believed that the pair had been exposed to a “novichok,” a complex nerve agent that had been developed by the Soviets, but Johnson was accused of misleading the public by saying that Britain’s top military laboratory had determined with certainty that the novichok used in the attack had come from Russia; the Defense Science and Technology Laboratory actually had only identified the substance as a novichok. Nonetheless, the British government was confident enough of the likelihood of Russian complicity in the attack that it expelled nearly two dozen Russian intelligence operatives who had been working in Britain under diplomatic cover. In May 2018 Johnson was the target of a prank—also thought to have been perpetrated by Russia—when a recording was made of a telephone conversation between him and a pair of individuals, one of whom fooled Johnson by pretending to be the new prime minister of Armenia. While all these events unfolded, Johnson remained a persistent advocate of “hard” Brexit as May’s government struggled to formulate the details of its exit strategy for its negotiations with the EU. Johnson publicly (and not always tactfully) cautioned May to not relinquish British autonomy in pursuit of maintaining close economic involvement in the common market. When May summoned her cabinet to Chequers, the prime minister’s country retreat, on July 6, 2018, to try to reach a nuts-and-bolts consensus on its Brexit plan, Johnson reportedly was crudely obstinate. Nonetheless, by the gathering’s end, he seemed to have joined the other cabinet members in support of May’s softer approach to Brexit. However, after Brexit secretary David Davis resigned on July 8, saying that he could not continue as Britain’s chief negotiator with the EU because May was “giving too much away, too easily,” Johnson followed suit the next day, tendering his resignation as foreign secretary. In his letter of resignation, Johnson wrote in part: It is more than two years since the British people voted to leave the European Union on an unambiguous and categorical promise that if they did so they would be taking back control of their democracy. They were told that they would be able to manage their own immigration policy, repatriate the sums of UK cash currently spent by the EU, and, above all, that they would be able to pass laws independently and in the interests of the people of this country.… That dream is dying, suffocated by needless self-doubt. May named Jeremy Hunt, the long-serving health secretary, as Johnson’s replacement.

Ascent to prime minister Meanwhile, Johnson remained a persistent critic of May’s attempts to push her version of Brexit through Parliament. After failing twice to win support for her plan in votes in the House of Commons, May, in a closed-door meeting with rank-and-file members of the Conservative Party on March 27, 2019, pledged to step down as prime minister if Parliament approved her plan. This time around, the promise of May’s imminent departure won Johnson’s support for her plan; however, once again it went down to defeat. Having failed to win sufficient support for her plan from Conservatives, unable to negotiate a compromise with the opposition, and assailed by ever more members of her own party, May announced that she would resign as party leader on June 7 but remain as caretaker prime minister until her party had chosen her successor. This opened up a campaign to replace her that found Johnson among 10 candidates who were put to the parliamentary party in a series of Ivotes that eventually winnowed the field to four contenders: Boris Johnson, Jeremy Hunt, Michael Gove, and Sajid Javid, the home secretary. After Gove and Javid fell by the wayside in subsequent votes, Johnson and Hunt stood as the final candidates in an election in which all of the party’s nearly 160,000 members were eligible to vote. Some 87 percent of those eligible voters participated and elevated Johnson to the leadership when the results were announced on July 23. In winning 92,153 votes, Johnson captured some 66 percent of the vote, compared with about 34 percent for Hunt, who garnered 46,656 votes. Johnson had campaigned on a promise to leave the EU without a deal (“no-deal Brexit”) if the exit agreement with the EU was not altered to his satisfaction by October 31, 2019, the revised departure deadline that had been negotiated by May. In his victory speech, he pledged to “deliver Brexit, unite the country, and defeat Jeremy Corbyn” and then rounded out the dud acronym for his pledge to dude by promising to “energize the country.” On July 24 Johnson officially became prime minister. Faced with a threat by Corbyn to hold a vote of confidence and then confronted by a broader effort by opponents of a no-deal Brexit to move toward legislation that would prevent that option for leaving the EU, Johnson boldly announced on August 28 that he had requested the queen to prorogue Parliament, delaying its resumption from its scheduled suspension for the yearly political party conferences. The schedule called for Parliament to convene during the first two weeks of September and then to take a break until October 9. Johnson reset the return date for October 14, just over two weeks before the Brexit deadline. The queen’s approval of the request, a formality, was granted shortly after it was submitted by Johnson. Outraged critics of Johnson’s initiative argued that he was seeking to limit debate and narrow the window of opportunity for taking legislative action on an alternative to a no-deal departure. Johnson denied that this was his intention and emphasized his desire to move forward on Britain’s domestic agenda. Opponents of a no-deal Brexit took the offensive on September 3, as members of the opposition and 21 rebellious Conservative MPs came together on a vote that allowed the House of Commons to temporarily usurp the government’s control of the legislative body’s agenda (as it had earlier done during May’s tenure as prime minister). The 328–301 vote was a humiliating defeat for Johnson, who responded vindictively by effectively expelling the 21 dissident MPs from the Conservative Party. Taking control of the agenda of the House of Commons allowed those opposed to a no-deal Brexit to set the stage for a vote on a bill that would mandate Johnson to request a delay for Brexit. Johnson sought to regain control of the narrative by announcing that he would call for a snap election. Under the Fixed Terms of Parliament Act, however, a prime minister must win the support of at least two-thirds of the House of Commons to hold such an election when it falls outside of the body’s fixed five-year terms, meaning that Johnson would have to win opposition support for that vote. The political drama heightened on September 4, as the House of Commons voted 327–299 to force Johnson to request a delay of the British withdrawal from the EU until January 31, 2020, if by October 19, 2019, he had not either submitted an agreement on Brexit for Parliament’s approval or gotten the House of Commons to approve a no-deal Brexit. By October Johnson was able to find common ground with the EU on a renegotiated agreement that greatly resembled May’s proposal but replaced the backstop with a plan to keep Northern Ireland aligned with the EU for at least four years from the end of the transition period. On October 22 the House of Commons approved Johnson’s revised plan in principle but then quickly stymied his effort to push the agreement through to formal Parliamentary acceptance before the October 31 deadline. Thus, Johnson was compelled to ask the EU for an extension of the deadline, which was granted, and the deadline was reset for January 31, 2020. With no-deal Brexit off the table, Corbyn indicated that he would now support an early election, which was scheduled for December 12. After three failed attempts to hold a snap election, Johnson was finally able to take his case to the people, and during the campaign he promised to deliver Brexit by the new deadline. Although Johnson’s solution to the backstop pitfall looked certain to lose him the support of the Democratic Unionist Party, opinion polling prior to the election showed the Conservatives to be the likely winners and poised to gain seats. When the votes were counted, the projected Conservative victory proved to be wildly more decisive than anyone had expected. In winning 365 seats, the party increased its presence in the House of Commons by 47 seats and recorded its most commanding win in a parliamentary election since 1987. With a solid majority in place, Johnson stood poised to guide his preferred version of Brexit across the finish line. In his address to the British people late on January 31, 2020, as the U.K. formally withdrew from the EU, Johnson said: This is the moment when the dawn breaks and the curtain goes up on a new act in our great national drama.

Battling the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 pandemic Although the formal withdrawal had taken place, final details relating to a new trade deal between the U.K. and the EU remained to be hammered out, and the deadline for agreement on this was set for December 31, 2020. Perhaps not surprisingly, those negotiations also proved to be protracted and often bitter; however, Johnson was able to announce that an accord had been reached on December 24. The 2,000-page agreement specified that there would be no limits or taxes on goods traded between U.K. and EU parties but there would now be a regimen of extensive paperwork for such transactions and for the transport of goods. Moreover, the freedom to live, work, and study in one another’s countries that U.K. nationals and EU citizens had enjoyed would be eliminated for many. Fishing rights, which had proved to be a particular sticking point in the negotiations, were agreed upon for a five-year period only. As important as these negotiations were, they took a back seat to the catastrophic public health crisis that came to dominate events not only in the U.K. and the EU but also in the world as a whole—the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 global pandemic, which likely originated in China, where the first cases were reported in December 2019. Heeding the controversial guidance of its key scientific advisers that the best way to limit the long-term effects of the pandemic would be to allow the virus to spread naturally and thus generate “herd immunity,” the Johnson government initially took a low-key approach to combating the pandemic, which was at odds with the aggressive measures taken in much of the rest of the world. By mid-March 2020, as COVID-19, the potentially deadly disease caused by the virus, began spreading rapidly in Britain, the fallacy of this approach had become clear, and the government imposed social-distancing and mask-wearing requirements, along with a lockdown that included the closing of schools, pubs, restaurants, and other businesses. The severity of the crisis became very personal for Johnson when he contracted the virus at the end of March, became so ill that he had to be hospitalized, and, with his life in danger, spent three nights in an intensive-care unit. While he was incapacitated, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab steered the government. After Johnson returned to his post, the grateful prime minister in his Easter message to the country on April 12 thanked the health care workers who had saved his life, called on Britons to adhere to social-distancing measures, and lavished praise on the National Health Service (NHS) for its response to the crisis: We will win because our NHS is the beating heart of this country. It is the best of this country. It is unconquerable. It is powered by love. Over the coming year, Johnson initiated and rescinded a series of stay-at-home orders (which varied by region) as the spread of the disease waxed and waned in Britain. Although many observers were critical of Johnson’s slow, unsteady response to the crisis, British scientists, aided by government funding, made historically rapid advances on the vaccine front. Notably, the University of Oxford and the Anglo-Swedish pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca developed and successfully tested one of the first effective vaccines. Moreover, in December 2020 the U.K. became the first country to approve and deploy the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, with which it quickly began a national immunization program. Nonetheless, by March 2021 the U.K. had suffered more COVID-19-related deaths (about 126,000) than all but four other countries (the United States, Brazil, Mexico, and India)—a situation that had been made worse in September 2020 by the emergence in Britain of a new, more easily transmissible variant of the disease (B.1.1.7).

“ Partygate” The Johnson government’s response to the pandemic would make headlines for very different reasons beginning in late November 2021, when reports began surfacing that members of the prime minister’s cabinet and staff, as well as Johnson himself, had attended parties earlier in the pandemic that violated prohibitions on social gatherings set forth by the government. Dubbed “Partygate,” the resulting scandal hinged not only on the nature of the alleged violations but also on Johnson’s initial insistence that the government-issued guidelines had been “followed at all times.” As reports came to light of an increasing number of illegal social gatherings at Downing Street, during lockdowns imposed because of the public health crisis in 2020 and 2021, Johnson apologized for having attended one such party at which drinks were served but which he said he had thought was going to be a work event. A picture began to emerge of a culture of excessive workplace drinking in Johnson’s orbit and of a prime minister who had misled Parliament with his claim that no pandemic-related rules had been broken—the last being an offense that historically had called for resignation. In late January 2022 an investigation into the affair by senior civil servant Sue Gray was reported to Parliament, though in a truncated and redacted form so as not to compromise the investigation into a number of gatherings that had been subsequently undertaken by the London Metropolitan Police. Gray indicated that “there were failures of leadership and judgment by different parts of No. 10 and the Cabinet Office at different times” and that “some of the events should not have been allowed to take place” whereas “other events should not have been allowed to develop as they did.” Johnson apologized again to Parliament and was roundly castigated, even by Conservatives, some of whom joined members of the opposition in calling on the prime minister to step down. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine on February 24, which united most of the West in support of Ukraine, seemed to forestall the threat to Johnson’s staying in office, as many Britons appeared to feel that the moment of existential crisis for Europe brought on by Russia’s aggression was not the time for a change of leadership. Nevertheless, Johnson’s grip on power remained precarious, especially after the police investigation led to Johnson’s being served a “fixed penalty notice” in April and being fined for his transgressions of pandemic-related rules, making him the first incumbent British prime minister in living memory found to have broken the law. By the first week of June, fallout from the release of the full report by Gray (in May) and growing discontent with the prime minister’s role in the Partygate scandal had led no fewer than 54 Conservative members of Parliament to send letters to the party’s 1922 Committee requesting Johnson’s resignation. Many of them were concerned that Johnson’s damaged brand would prove to be a liability in the next scheduled parliamentary elections, some two years in the offing. With the number of written requests required to force a vote on leadership of the party having been met, 359 Conservative members of Parliament on the evening of June 6 participated in a secret ballot vote of confidence in Johnson. To survive as leader, Johnson needed to get 180 affirmative votes. He got 211, but the 148 MPs who voted against him constituted roughly 40 percent of the party’s representation in the House of Commons and exceeded in number the 133 MPs who had voted against Theresa May in the 2018 vote of confidence in her leadership that preceded her resignation by some six months. Under party rules, a subsequent vote on Johnson’s leadership could not be held for another year, but, as Britain struggled with inflated prices of fuel and groceries, public approval of the Labour Party was growing in preference polling that did not bode well for Johnson. Moreover, he had very publicly lost the support of prominent Tories such Jeremy Hunt and William Hague.

Resignation in disgrace Only weeks after he survived the confidence vote, Johnson’s standing as party leader was further shaken by the loss of two Conservative seats in by-elections on June 24, 2022, in Tiverton and Honiton and in Wakefield. Sexual scandals had forced the resignation of the Conservative MPs holding those seats, and in early July Johnson’s handling of another sexual scandal, involving Conservative Deputy Chief Whip Chris Pincher, would finally force the resignation of the embattled prime minister whose grip on power had for so long seemed impervious to scandal. This time Johnson and his spokespeople repeatedly changed their story regarding Johnson’s awareness of allegations of sexual misconduct that had been brought against Pincher both in the run-up to his appointment as deputy chief whip and in 2019 during his tenure in the Foreign Office. When Johnson ultimately claimed that he simply had forgotten being briefed about Pincher’s 2019 indiscretion, it proved to be the last straw for two key ministers, Health Secretary Sajid Javid and Treasury chief Rishi Sunak, who resigned their cabinet posts on July 5. Despite the short-term statutory protection against another vote of confidence in Johnson’s party leadership, his support within the parliamentary Conservative Party continued to crumble, and senior party members threatened to change the party rules to allow for another confidence vote if Johnson did not resign. Despite the multitude of defections, Johnson initially dug in his heels. Indeed, he fired his erstwhile ally Michael Gove from his position as levelling up secretary after Gove joined in pressuring Johnson to resign. Finally, on July 7 Johnson announced his immediate resignation as party leader but said that he would remain as prime minister until the Conservatives had chosen a new leader. On September 6, Liz Truss, Johnson’s foreign secretary, replaced him as prime minister, though her tenure in office would prove to be the shortest in British history. Still immensely popular with the party’s base, Johnson was under consideration as Truss’s replacement despite his fall from grace. During the scramble to choose a new Conservative leader in October, Johnson made a hurried return to Britain from a vacation in the Dominican Republic, but he chose rather quickly to stand aside in deference to Sunak. On June 9, 2023, Johnson received the final report of the Privileges Committee, a cross-party investigatory body that had been tasked with determining whether or not he had willingly misled Parliament during the Partygate scandal. He announced his resignation as MP that day, decrying the committee as a “kangaroo court” that had been determined to “drive me out of Parliament.” Johnson’s Unleashed, a memoir, was published in 2024."

President Joseph Robinette Biden, Jr. was born in Scranton, Pennsylvania, the first of four children of Catherine Eugenia Finnegan Biden and Joseph Robinette Biden, Sr. In 1953, the Biden family moved to Claymont, Delaware. President Biden graduated from the University of Delaware and Syracuse Law School and served on the New Castle County Council.

Joe Biden’s Family

At age 29, President Biden became one of the youngest Americans ever elected to the United States Senate. Just weeks after his Senate election, tragedy struck when his wife Neilia and daughter Naomi were killed, and sons Hunter and Beau were critically injured, in a car accident. He was sworn into the U.S. Senate at his sons’ hospital bedsides and began commuting from Wilmington to Washington every day, first by car, and then by train, in order to be with his family. In 1977, he married Jill Jacobs, and in 1980, their family was complete with the birth of their daughter Ashley.

As a Senator from Delaware for 36 years, then-Senator Biden played a leading role addressing some of our nation’s most important domestic and international challenges, including writing the Violence Against Women Act. As Vice President, he worked alongside President Obama to secure passage of the Affordable Care Act, oversee the then-largest economic recovery plan in history, and strengthen American leadership on the world stage.

President Biden accomplished more for the American people in four years than most Presidents have in eight.

The 46th President of the United States

Four years ago, we stood in a winter of peril and a winter of possibilities. We were in the grip of the worst pandemic in a century, the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression, and the worst attack on our democracy since the Civil War. But we came together as Americans, and we got through it. We emerged stronger, more prosperous, and more secure.

Today, we have the strongest economy in the world and have created a record 16 million new jobs. Wages are up. Inflation continues to come down. The racial wealth gap is the lowest it’s been in 20 years. We’re rebuilding our entire nation—urban, suburban, rural, and Tribal communities. Manufacturing has come back to America. We’re leading the world again in science and innovation, including the semiconductor industry. And we finally beat Big Pharma to lower the cost of prescription drugs for seniors. More people have health insurance today in America than ever before. I signed one of the most significant laws helping millions of veterans and their families who were exposed to toxic materials, as well as the most significant climate law ever and the first major gun safety law in 30 years. Today, violent crime rate is at a 50-year low.

In 2020, President Biden ran for the White House to restore the Soul of America, rebuild the backbone of America – the middle class, and unite the country. After being sworn in as the 46th President on January 20th, 2021, he took swift action to get America vaccinated and jumpstart an economic recovery that created more jobs than any other President has created in four years. The President’s agenda is investing in all Americans. His Bipartisan Infrastructure Law is rebuilding our roads and bridges, removing lead pipes, and expanding high-speed internet access. His Inflation Reduction Act is the largest investment in climate action in history. And his CHIPS and Science Act is making cutting-edge technology here in America with American workers.

The President beat Big Pharma – negotiating lower prescription drug costs and capping insulin at $35 a month for seniors. His agenda is lowering health insurance costs, cutting utility bills, and taking on corporate rip-offs like junk fees. The President nominated the first Black woman to serve on the Supreme Court, Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson. He signed into law the first meaningful gun safety bill in nearly 30 years. And on the world stage, President Biden has strengthened our alliances and restored American leadership. He has rallied the world to stand up to Putin’s aggression in Ukraine, expanded NATO which is now larger and stronger than ever before, and increased America’s influence in the Indo-Pacific.

President Biden came to office determined to build an administration that looks like America — and that’s what he’s done. He served as Vice President to the nation’s first Black President, and now serves as President alongside the nation’s first Black woman to be Vice President. President Biden has been at the center of the great American story of expanding opportunity and making real the promise of America to everyone."

Emmanuel Macron, France,en,https://apnews.com/article/france-macron-trump-ukraine-nuclear-power-0614a6ddba1b9ef7d4b24c14356546ce,"PARIS (AP) — French President Emmanuel Macron is back at the center of global diplomacy, seeking to ease relations with President Donald Trump, championing a Ukraine peace plan alongside his British counterpart, and seeing his longstanding desire to boost European defense turning into reality.

Six months ago, Macron seemed weaker than ever after his call for early legislative elections produced a hung parliament, sparking an unprecedented crisis. Known for his nonstop political activism, Macron shifted his focus to foreign policy, leaving domestic struggles largely to the prime minister.

Now, he appears as the one leader who speaks to Trump several times per week and takes the lead in European support for Ukraine, while positioning himself as the commander-in-chief of the European Union’s only nuclear power.

Key world player

Macron, 47, is one of the few leaders who knew Trump during his first term in office, maintaining despite disagreements a cordial relationship, which both describe as “friendship.”

He was the first European leader to visit Trump since his reelection, seeking to persuade him not to abandon Ukraine in pursuit of a peace deal with Russia.

Macron is also a heavyweight of European politics, and shifting U.S. policies gave momentum to his longstanding views.

Since he was first elected in 2017, Macron has pushed for a stronger, more sovereign Europe. That same year, in a sweeping speech at Sorbonne University, he called for a common European defense policy, with increased military cooperation and joint defense initiatives.

He later lamented the “brain death” of the NATO military alliance, insisting the EU should step up and start acting as a strategic world power.

On Thursday, EU leaders committed to strengthening defenses and freeing up hundreds of billions of euros for security in the wake of Trump’s warnings that they might face the Russian threat alone.

Nuclear power

In a resounding declaration last week, Macron announced he would discuss extending France’s nuclear deterrent to European partners to help protect the continent.

France’s nuclear power is inherited from the strategy set by wartime hero Gen. Charles de Gaulle, president from 1958 to 1969, who sought to maintain France’s independence from the U.S. and assert the country’s role as a global power. That went through the development of an independent French nuclear arsenal.

Poland and Baltic nations welcomed the proposal.

France’s Minister for European affairs Benjamin Haddad praised Macron’s efforts, saying they were aimed at ensuring that “in the face of this world upheaval, Europeans are not spectators but players.”

New British and German partners

Some other key players appear to back Macron’s approach.

British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, in office for eight months, has sought closer defense cooperation with Europe as part of a “reset” with the EU after years of bitterness over Brexit.

Macron and Starmer are now spearheading a desperate diplomatic drive to bolster Ukraine’s defenses, drawing up a peace plan with Kyiv at its core. That plan includes the possibility of sending European troops to Ukraine to enforce a potential peace agreement.

Meanwhile, Germany’s conservative election winner Friedrich Merz said his top priority would be to “strengthen Europe as soon as possible” and gradually move toward “real independence” from the U.S.

Only three days after his victory last month, Merz, who has called for a discussion on “nuclear sharing” with France, traveled to Paris for a working dinner with Macron.

No statement was released after the meeting, but French officials with knowledge of the matter said both men’s visions for Europe align. They spoke anonymously because the talks were not to be made public.

Russia’s criticism

Russia’s foreign ministry accused Macron of “demonstrative militarism dictated by the domestic agenda.”

The ministry said that Macron seeks to distract the French public from “worsening socio-economic problems in France and the European Union.”

Moscow dismissed Macron’s nuclear deterrent offer as “extremely confrontational,” saying the remarks reflected Paris’ ambitions to “become the nuclear ‘patron’ of all of Europe,” despite the fact that France’s nuclear forces are far smaller than those of the U.S.

Russian President Vladimir Putin drew a comparison with Napoleon, saying that some people “want to return to the times of Napoleon, forgetting how it ended” — a reference to the emperor’s failed invasion of Russia in 1812. Macron responded by calling Putin “an imperialist.”

Reinvigorated at home

Reelected in 2022, Macron last year struggled not to become a lame duck after his call for early legislative elections led to a chaotic situation in parliament, delaying the approval of the state budget and forcing the quick replacement of the prime minister.

However, the French Constitution grants the president some substantial powers over foreign policy, European affairs and defense. Macron has a presidential mandate until 2027 and he has said he won’t step down before the end of his term.

Macron’s activism on the global stage drew criticism from opposition leaders.

Far-right National Rally party vice president Sébastien Chenu described Macron’s “moody” character as “one of the biggest issues” for French diplomacy. “He offended many people, he often changed his mind,” Chenu said.

The head of the hard-left France Unbowed group at the National Assembly, Mathilde Panot, also voiced concerns.

“The situation is too serious and the President of the Republic is too weakened for him to decide on his own,” she said. “We don’t just want to be consulted. ... It’s up to the parliament to decide on such serious issues.”

Boris Johnson, United Kingdom,en,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/mar/09/still-uncertain-about-trump-let-boris-johnson-guide-you-on-this-very-compassionate-man,"Short of emigration, what is the best option for Britain’s dazzled Trump followers now their hero confirms he is not Europe’s ally but Vladimir Putin’s? That’s assuming what we can’t in the case of Nigel Farage MP: that they do not share the US president’s well-documented weakness for a genocidal invader. Even his more respectable British acolytes have until recently finessed, quite successfully, their love of Trump with his long history of Putin-pleasing. No one more so than Boris Johnson, former prime minister, self-styled saviour of Ukraine and still Trump’s most dependable British idiot.

To Johnson’s way of thinking, detailed in numerous Daily Mail columns, it is Trump-doubters who are always the ridiculous, panicking, hysterical, whingeing headless chickens. When Trump looked likely to win the US election, Johnson likened the reaction of the “western liberal intelligentsia” to “the shriek of elderly beldames leaping on the piano stool after spying a mouse in their petticoats”. The virile Johnson was more than willing to forget that business at the US Capitol on 6 January 2021.

With all the usual caveats, it is striking, sometimes uncanny, how often tributes to Trump by his UK supporters have echoed rhetoric in praise of an earlier political disruptor with territorial ambitions.

Here is Lord Rothermere, the Daily Mail proprietor, for instance, writing in 1930 that his support for Germany’s Nazi party “had shocked the old women of three countries – France, Germany, and our own”. Like the beldame-connoisseur Johnson, who urges us to disregard Trump’s thuggery – “I have always found him, personally, a model of old-fashioned courtesy and good manners” – Rothermere would assure readers disconcerted by the public shrieking that the private Hitler was “a perfect gentleman”, who “brings to Europe the blessed prospect of peace”.

Anything that may to the uninitiated seem disgraceful about Trump could be proof of political sophistication

A century later, another Daily Mail writer, Nadine Dorries, was one of several prominent Conservatives claiming something similar for Trump. “I honestly believe that Trump can bring about world peace and prosperity.” By way of references, Dorries cited, like many of the president’s supporters, the strategic mastery outlined in his (ghostwritten) Art of the Deal. Have any of them actually read the chapter that details how Trump, having attempted various low ruses to dislodge residents from a newly acquired building he wished to demolish, ended up being accused of harassment? It could be of interest, anyway, to Gaza residents should Trump persist with dreams of a Palestinian-free luxury resort.

Admittedly, a little alleged harassment is unlikely to weigh with women like Dorries, Suella Braverman and Liz Truss (not forgetting proud feminist Johnson) who are happy to make light of – along with the invasion of the White House, environmental savagery and assorted criminal cases – Trump’s history of misogyny. For them, saviour qualities that polls suggest go unrecognised by most of the British population have earned him immunity from sustained sexist behaviour, from “Grab ’em by the pussy” to congratulating the prime minister, Keir Starmer, on his “beautiful” wife last month.

In the US for Trump’s inauguration, an ecstatic Braverman said that he provides “a glimmer of hope of what is possible in the west”. Fellow guest Truss, cementing the Norfolk-Mar-a-Lago axis, hailed the incoming president for “saving western civilisation”. Starting, as we now know, with Andrew Tate.

Inconveniently for Truss and other lead Trumpists including Robert Jenrick, Jacob Rees-Mogg, Piers Morgan, Priti Patel, Andrea Jenkyns and a number of Mail and Telegraph contributors, today’s online archive makes it trickier than in 1939 for the prominent and susceptible to pretend they were never infatuated with an amoral racist and conspiracy theorist.

Added to this evidence, the speed of Trump’s transition into full Russia allyship could help extravagant claims about his political genius being more rapidly understood as deranged than those, circulating last year, that rested on total public memory loss about Trump’s political past.

For the former Tory MP Rees-Mogg, for instance, Trump’s victory was “a success for democracy” and also, notwithstanding his thing for Putin, for “free speech”. The pivot towards Russia has not diminished his loyalty. “Reinvigorating democracy is also positive,” Mogg noted, finding something “creative” in Trump’s denial of military assistance to Ukraine, “the world may ultimately be a safer place”.

Braverman, the proud wearer of a Maga cap and perhaps the closest Trump has to a Unity Mitford (who favoured a golden swastika), considers his latest actions above all “a wake-up call for European nations”.

In news sources where recent expressions of admiration for Trump must adapt to growing public suspicion, there is no avoiding a more convoluted response. In the Telegraph, where he acclaimed Trump’s November victory with “Trump is the last chance to save the decaying west from terminal decline”, Allister Heath now reminds readers, “the reality is nuanced”.

Critical to this delicate work is the claim that anything that may to the uninitiated seem disgraceful about Trump, like his televised humiliation and abuse of Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, could in fact be proof of political sophistication beyond the grasp of literal-minded liberals: the sort of people who see Elon Musk, Trump favourite and Alternative for Germany sympathiser, extend his arm sharply upwards and think they’ve witnessed a Nazi salute.

Current advice for any Trump worshipper with reason to regret recent Rothermeresque effusions about renewed hope for western civilisation, is to emulate Boris Johnson. Step by step, they should advance from simple Trump idolator to the role of senior Trump interpreter. Supposing Trump comes up with something like (to Zelenskyy) “you should never have started it”, requires a Johnson, fluent in Trumpspeak, to translate: “Trump’s statements are not intended to be historically accurate but to shock Europeans into action.” What might sound wicked, according to his latest tutorial, is spoken by a “very compassionate man”.

Recent polling, inauspicious for Farage, suggests that Johnson’s linguistic efforts are finally paying off. When a UK legislator sings the praises of Trump, what they are actually saying is: “I am unworthy of political office.” Got it.
