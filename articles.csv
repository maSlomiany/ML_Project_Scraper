Joseph Robinette Biden Jr.[b] (born November 20, 1942) is an American politician who was the 46th president of the United States from 2021 to 2025. A member of the Democratic Party, he served as the 47th vice president from 2009 to 2017 under President Barack Obama, and represented Delaware in the U.S. Senate from 1973 to 2009.

Born in Scranton, Pennsylvania, Biden graduated from the University of Delaware in 1965 and the Syracuse University College of Law in 1968. He was elected to the New Castle County Council in 1970 and the U.S. Senate in 1972. As a senator, Biden led the effort to pass the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act and the Violence Against Women Act. He also oversaw six U.S. Supreme Court confirmation hearings, including the contentious hearings for Robert Bork and Clarence Thomas. Biden ran unsuccessfully for the 1988 and 2008 Democratic presidential nominations. In 2008, Obama chose Biden as his running mate, and he was a close counselor to Obama as vice president. In the 2020 presidential election, Biden selected Kamala Harris as his running mate, and they defeated Republican incumbents Donald Trump and Mike Pence. He became the first president with a woman vice president.

As president, Biden signed the American Rescue Plan Act in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent recession. He signed bipartisan bills on infrastructure and manufacturing. He proposed the Build Back Better Act, which failed in Congress. Aspects of the bill were subsequently incorporated into the Inflation Reduction Act, which he signed into law in 2022. He appointed Ketanji Brown Jackson to the Supreme Court. In his foreign policy, the U.S. reentered the Paris Agreement. Biden oversaw the complete withdrawal of U.S. troops that ended the war in Afghanistan, leading to the the Taliban seizing control. He responded to the Russian invasion of Ukraine by imposing sanctions on Russia and authorizing aid to Ukraine. During the Gaza war, Biden strongly supported Israel's military efforts, and sent limited humanitarian aid to the Gaza Strip. A ceasefire proposal was adopted shortly before he left office.

Concerns about Biden's age and health persisted throughout his term. He became the first president to turn 80 while in office. He began his presidency with majority support, but saw his approval ratings decline throughout his presidency, in part due to public frustration over supply chain shortages and inflation, which peaked at 9.1% in June 2022 but dropped to 2.9% by the end of his presidency. He initially ran for reelection and, after the Democratic primaries, became the party's presumptive nominee in the 2024 presidential election.[1] After his performance in the first presidential debate, renewed scrutiny from across the political spectrum about his cognitive ability led him to withdraw his candidacy. During his term, historians and political scientists ranked Biden in the second quartile of U.S. presidents, diverging from public assessments of his tenure. Polling aggregator FiveThirtyEight found that Biden had a final average approval rating of 37%.[2]

Early life (1942–1965)

Joseph Robinette Biden Jr. was born on November 20, 1942,[3] at St. Mary's Hospital in Scranton, Pennsylvania, to Catherine Eugenia ""Jean"" Biden (née Finnegan) and Joseph Robinette Biden Sr.[5][6] He was the oldest child in a Catholic family of mostly Irish descent. He has a sister, Valerie, and two brothers, Francis and James.

Biden's father had been wealthy, and the family purchased a home in the affluent Long Island suburb of Garden City in 1946,[8] but he suffered business setbacks around the time Biden was seven years old,[9][10] and for several years the family lived with Biden's maternal grandparents in Scranton.[12] Scranton fell into economic decline during the 1950s, and Biden's father could not find steady work.[13] Beginning in 1953 when Biden was ten,[14] the family lived in an apartment in Claymont, Delaware, before moving to a house in nearby Mayfield, Delaware.[15][16][10][12] Biden Sr. later became a successful used-car salesman, maintaining the family in a middle-class lifestyle.[12][13][17]

At Archmere Academy in Claymont, Biden played baseball and was a standout halfback and wide receiver on the high school football team.[12][19] Though a poor student, he was class president in his junior and senior years. He graduated in 1961. At the University of Delaware in Newark, Biden briefly played freshman football,[22][23] and, as an unexceptional student,[24] received a Bachelor of Arts degree with a double major in history and political science in 1965.[25] Biden had a stutter and has mitigated it since his early twenties.[27]

Marriages, law school, and early career (1966–1973)

Biden married Neilia Hunter, a student at Syracuse University, on August 27, 1966,[25][28] after overcoming her parents' disinclination for her to wed a Catholic. Their wedding was held in a Catholic church in Skaneateles, New York.[29] They had three children: Joseph R. ""Beau"" Biden III, Robert Hunter Biden, and Naomi Christina ""Amy"" Biden.[25]

Biden earned a Juris Doctor from Syracuse University College of Law in 1968. In his first year of law school, he failed a course because he plagiarized a law review article, but the failing grade was later stricken. His grades were relatively poor, and he graduated 76th in a class of 85.[24] He was admitted to the Delaware bar in 1969.[3]

Biden clerked at a Wilmington law firm headed by prominent local Republican William Prickett in 1968 and, he later said, ""thought of myself as a Republican"".[30][31] He disliked incumbent Democratic Delaware governor Charles L. Terry's conservative racial politics and supported a more liberal Republican, Russell W. Peterson, who defeated Terry in 1968.[30] Local Republicans attempted to recruit Biden, but he registered as an Independent because of his distaste for Republican presidential candidate Richard Nixon.[30]

Law practices

Biden in the Syracuse 1968 yearbook

In 1969, Biden practiced law, first as a public defender and then at a law firm headed by a locally active Democrat,[32][30] who named him to the Democratic Forum, a group trying to reform and revitalize the state party; Biden subsequently reregistered as a Democrat.[30] He and another attorney also formed a law firm.[32] Corporate law did not appeal to him, and criminal law did not pay well.[12] He supplemented his income by managing properties.[34]

Biden ran for the fourth district seat on the New Castle County Council in 1970 on a liberal platform that included support for public housing in the suburbs.[36] Biden won the general election, defeating Republican Lawrence T. Messick, and took office on January 5, 1971.[37][38] He served until January 1, 1973.[39] During his time on the county council, Biden opposed large highway projects, which he argued might disrupt Wilmington neighborhoods.

Biden had not openly supported or opposed the Vietnam War until he ran for Senate and opposed Richard Nixon's conduct of the war. While studying at the University of Delaware and Syracuse University, Biden obtained five student draft deferments. Based on a physical examination, he was given a conditional medical deferment in 1968; in 2008, a spokesperson for Biden said his having had ""asthma as a teenager"" was the reason.[42]

1972 U.S. Senate campaign in Delaware

Biden defeated Republican incumbent J. Caleb Boggs to become the junior U.S. senator from Delaware in 1972. He was the only Democrat willing to challenge Boggs and, with minimal campaign funds, he was thought to have no chance of winning.[32][12] Family members managed and staffed the campaign, which relied on meeting voters face-to-face and hand-distributing position papers,[43] an approach made feasible by Delaware's small size.[34] He received help from the AFL-CIO and Democratic pollster Patrick Caddell.[32] His platform focused on the environment, withdrawal from Vietnam, civil rights, mass transit, equitable taxation, health care and public dissatisfaction with ""politics as usual"".[32][43] A few months before the election, Biden trailed Boggs by almost thirty percentage points,[32] but his energy, attractive young family, and ability to connect with voters' emotions worked to his advantage,[17] and he won with 50.5% of the vote.[43]

Death of wife and daughter

A few weeks after Biden was elected senator, his wife Neilia and one-year-old daughter Naomi were killed in an automobile accident in Hockessin, Delaware, on December 18, 1972.[25][44] Their sons Beau (aged 3) and Hunter (aged 2) were in the car and were taken to hospital with non-life-threatening injuries. Biden considered resigning to care for them,[17] but Senate Majority Leader Mike Mansfield persuaded him not to.[46] Biden contemplated suicide and was filled with anger and religious doubt.[47][48] He wrote that he ""felt God had played a horrible trick"" on him[49] and had trouble focusing on work.[50][51]

Second marriage

Biden and his second wife, Jill, met in 1975 and married in 1977

Biden met teacher Jill Tracy Jacobs in 1975 on a blind date.[52] They married at the United Nations chapel in New York on June 17, 1977,[53][54] and spent their honeymoon at Lake Balaton in the Hungarian People's Republic.[55][56] Biden credits her with the renewal of his interest in politics and life.[57]

In 1981, the couple had a daughter, Ashley Biden.[25] She is a social worker.[58] Jill helped raise her stepsons, Hunter and Beau, who were seven and eight respectively at the time of her marriage. Hunter has worked as a Washington lobbyist and investment adviser; his business dealings, personal life, and legal troubles have come under significant scrutiny during his father's presidency. In December 2024, Biden pardoned Hunter following his conviction on gun and tax charges despite repeated promises that he would not do so.[59][60][61][62] Beau became an Army judge-advocate in Iraq and later Delaware attorney general;[63] he died of brain cancer in 2015.[64][65]

Teaching

From 1991 to 2008, as an adjunct professor, Biden co-taught a seminar on constitutional law at Widener University School of Law.[66][67]

U.S. Senate (1973–2009)

Senate activities

Biden with President Jimmy Carter, 1978

Elected to the U.S. Senate in 1972, Biden was reelected in 1978, 1984, 1990, 1996, 2002, and 2008, regularly receiving about 60% of the vote.[68] Aged 30 when first elected, he was the seventh-youngest senator in U.S. history.[69] He was junior senator to William Roth until Roth was defeated in 2000.[70] As of 2024 , he was the 19th-longest-serving senator in U.S. history.[71]

During his early years in the Senate, Biden focused on consumer protection and environmental issues and called for greater government accountability.[72] In a 1974 interview, he described himself as liberal on civil rights and liberties, senior citizens' concerns and healthcare, but conservative on other issues, including abortion and military conscription.[73] Biden was the first U.S. senator to endorse Jimmy Carter for president in the 1976 Democratic primary.[74] Carter won the Democratic nomination and the 1976 election. Biden also worked on arms control.[75][76] After Congress failed to ratify the SALT II Treaty signed in 1979 by Soviet general secretary Leonid Brezhnev and President Jimmy Carter, Biden met with Soviet foreign minister Andrei Gromyko and secured changes that addressed the Senate Foreign Relations Committee's objections.[77] He received considerable attention when he excoriated Secretary of State George Shultz at a Senate hearing for the Reagan administration's support of South Africa despite its policy of apartheid.[30] In a congressional hearing in 1984, he objected to the Strategic Defense Initiative plan to construct autonomous systems of ICBM defense.[78][79]

Equality movements

In the mid-1970s, Biden was one of the Senate's strongest opponents of race-integration busing. His Delaware constituents strongly opposed it, and such opposition nationwide later led his party to mostly abandon school integration policies.[80] In his first Senate campaign, Biden had expressed support for busing to remedy de jure segregation, as in the South, but opposed its use to remedy de facto segregation arising from racial patterns of neighborhood residency, as in Delaware; he opposed a proposed constitutional amendment banning busing entirely. Biden supported a 1976 measure forbidding the use of federal funds for transporting students beyond the school closest to them.[80] He co-sponsored a 1977 amendment closing loopholes in that measure, which President Carter signed into law in 1978.[82]

Biden shaking hands with President Ronald Reagan, 1984

Biden became ranking minority member of the Senate Judiciary Committee in 1981. He was a Democratic floor manager for the successful passage of the Comprehensive Crime Control Act in 1984. His supporters praised him for modifying some of the law's worst provisions, and it was his most important legislative accomplishment to that time.[83] In 1994, Biden helped pass the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act, which included a ban on assault weapons,[84][85] and the Violence Against Women Act,[86] which he has called his most significant legislation.[87] The 1994 crime law was unpopular among progressives and criticized for resulting in mass incarceration;[88][89] in 2019, Biden called his role in passing the bill a ""big mistake"", saying it ""trapped an entire generation"".[90]

Biden meeting with attorney general Janet Reno, 1993

Biden voted for a 1993 provision that deemed homosexuality incompatible with military life, thereby banning gay people from serving in the armed forces.[91][92] In 1996, he voted for the Defense of Marriage Act, which prohibited the federal government from recognizing same-sex marriages, thereby barring people in such marriages from equal protection under federal law and allowing states to do the same.[93] In 2015, the act was ruled unconstitutional in Obergefell v. Hodges.[94]

Biden was critical of Independent Counsel Ken Starr during the 1990s Whitewater controversy and Lewinsky scandal investigations, saying ""it's going to be a cold day in hell"" before another independent counsel would be granted similar powers.[95] He voted to acquit during the impeachment of Bill Clinton.[96] During the 2000s, Biden sponsored bankruptcy legislation sought by credit card issuers.[17] Bill Clinton vetoed the bill in 2000, but it passed in 2005 as the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act,[17] with Biden being one of only 18 Democrats to vote for it, while leading Democrats and consumer rights organizations opposed it.[97] As a senator, Biden strongly supported increased Amtrak funding and rail security.[68][98]

Brain surgeries

In February 1988, after several episodes of severe neck pain, Biden underwent surgery to correct a leaking intracranial berry aneurysm.[99][100] While recuperating, he suffered a pulmonary embolism.[100] A second aneurysm was surgically repaired in May.[100][101] His recuperation kept him away from the Senate for seven months.[102]

Senate Judiciary Committee

Biden was a longtime member of the Senate Committee on the Judiciary. He chaired it from 1987 to 1995 and was a ranking minority member from 1981 to 1987 and again from 1995 to 1997.[103]

As chair, Biden presided over two highly contentious U.S. Supreme Court confirmation hearings.[17] When Robert Bork was nominated in 1988, Biden reversed his approval‍—‌given in an interview the previous year‍—‌of a hypothetical Bork nomination. Conservatives were angered, but at the hearings' close Biden was praised for his fairness, humor, and courage.[105] Rejecting the arguments of some Bork opponents,[17] Biden framed his objections to Bork in terms of the conflict between Bork's strong originalism and the view that the U.S. Constitution provides rights to liberty and privacy beyond those explicitly enumerated in its text.[105] Bork's nomination was rejected in the committee by a 5–9 vote[105] and then in the full Senate, 42–58.[106]

During Clarence Thomas's nomination hearings in 1991, Biden's questions on constitutional issues were often convoluted to the point that Thomas sometimes lost track of them, and Thomas later wrote that Biden's questions were akin to ""beanballs"".[108] After the committee hearing closed, the public learned that Anita Hill had accused Thomas of making unwelcome sexual comments when they had worked together.[109][110] Biden had known of some of these charges, but initially shared them only with the committee because Hill was then unwilling to testify.[17] The committee hearing was reopened and Hill testified, but Biden did not permit testimony from other witnesses, such as a woman who had made similar charges and experts on harassment.[111] The full Senate confirmed Thomas by a 52–48 vote, with Biden opposed.[17] Liberal legal advocates and women's groups felt strongly that Biden had mishandled the hearings and not done enough to support Hill.[111] In 2019, he told Hill he regretted his treatment of her, but Hill said afterward she remained unsatisfied.[112]

Senate Foreign Relations Committee

Biden was a longtime member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. He became its ranking minority member in 1997 and chaired it from June 2001 to 2003 and 2007 to 2009.[113] His positions were generally liberal internationalist.[75][114] He collaborated effectively with Republicans and sometimes went against elements of his own party.[113][114] During this time he met with at least 150 leaders from 60 countries and international organizations, becoming a well-known Democratic voice on foreign policy.[115]

Biden voted against authorization for the Gulf War in 1991.[114] He became interested in the Yugoslav Wars after hearing about Serbian abuses during the Croatian War of Independence in 1991.[75] Once the Bosnian War broke out, Biden was among the first to call for the ""lift and strike"" policy.[75][113] The George H. W. Bush administration and Clinton administration were both reluctant to implement the policy, fearing Balkan entanglement.[75][114] In April 1993, Biden had a tense three-hour meeting with Serbian leader Slobodan Milošević.[116] Biden worked on several versions of legislative language urging the U.S. toward greater involvement.[116] He has called his role in affecting Balkan policy in the mid-1990s his ""proudest moment in public life"" related to foreign policy.[114] In 1999, during the Kosovo War, Biden supported the 1999 NATO bombing of FR Yugoslavia.[75] He and Senator John McCain co-sponsored the McCain-Biden Kosovo Resolution, which called on Clinton to use all necessary force, including ground troops, to confront Milošević over Yugoslav actions toward Kosovo Albanians.[114][117]

Wars in Afghanistan and Iraq

Biden addresses the press after meeting with Prime Minister Ayad Allawi in Baghdad in 2004.

Biden was a strong supporter of the War in Afghanistan, saying, ""Whatever it takes, we should do it.""[118] As head of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, he said in 2002 that Iraqi president Saddam Hussein was a threat to national security and there was no other option than to ""eliminate"" that threat.[119] In October 2002, he voted in favor of the Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Iraq, approving the U.S. invasion of Iraq.[114] As chair of the committee, he assembled witnesses to testify in favor of the authorization. They gave testimony grossly misrepresenting the intent, history, and status of Saddam and his government, and touted Iraq's fictional possession of weapons of mass destruction.[120] Biden eventually became a critic of the war and called his role a ""mistake"", but did not push for withdrawal.[114][116] He supported the appropriations for the occupation, but argued that the war should be internationalized, that more soldiers were needed, and that the Bush administration should ""level with the American people"" about its cost and length.[113][117]

By late 2006, Biden's stance had shifted considerably. He opposed the troop surge of 2007,[114][116] saying General David Petraeus was ""dead, flat wrong"" in believing the surge could work.[121] Biden instead advocated dividing Iraq into a loose federation of three ethnic states.[122] In September 2007, a non-binding resolution endorsing the plan passed the Senate,[124] but the idea failed to gain traction.[121]

1988 and 2008 presidential campaigns

1988 campaign

Biden speaks at a campaign event, 1987

Biden declared his candidacy for the 1988 Democratic presidential nomination on June 9, 1987.[125] He was considered a strong candidate because of his moderate image, his speaking ability, his high profile as chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee at the upcoming Robert Bork Supreme Court nomination hearings, and his appeal to Baby Boomers.[30][126] He raised more in the first quarter of 1987 than any other candidate.[126]

By August, Biden's campaign messaging had become confused due to staff rivalries, and in September, he was accused of plagiarizing a speech by British Labour Party leader Neil Kinnock.[129] Biden had credited Kinnock on previous occasions,[130][131] but did not on two occasions in August.[132]: 230–232 [131] Earlier that year, Biden had also used passages from a speech by Robert F. Kennedy (for which his aides took blame) and John F. Kennedy's inaugural address; two years earlier he had used a 1976 passage by Hubert Humphrey.[133] Biden responded that politicians often borrow from one another without giving credit, and that one of his rivals for the nomination, Jesse Jackson, had called him to point out that he (Jackson) had used the same material by Humphrey that Biden had used.[17][24] A few days later, it was publicized that, while in law school, Biden had taken text from a Fordham Law Review article with inadequate citations.[24] At Biden's request the Delaware Supreme Court's Board of Professional Responsibility reviewed the incident and concluded that he had violated no rules.[134]

Biden has made several false or exaggerated claims about his early life: that he had earned three degrees in college, that he attended law school on a full scholarship, that he had graduated in the top half of his class,[135][136] and that he had marched in the civil rights movement.[137] The limited amount of other news about the presidential race amplified these disclosures,[138] and on September 23, 1987, Biden withdrew his candidacy.[139]

2008 campaign

Biden campaigns at a house party in Creston, Iowa, July 2007.

After exploring running in several previous cycles, in January 2007, Biden declared his candidacy in the 2008 elections.[68][140][141] Biden focused on the Iraq War, his record as chairman of major Senate committees, and his foreign-policy experience.[142] Biden was noted for his one-liners during the campaign; in one debate he said of Republican candidate Rudy Giuliani, ""There's only three things he mentions in a sentence: a noun, and a verb and 9/11.""[143]

Biden had difficulty raising funds, struggled to draw people to his rallies, and failed to gain traction against the high-profile candidacies of Obama and Hillary Clinton.[144] He never rose above single digits in national polls of the Democratic candidates. In the first contest on January 3, 2008, Biden placed fifth in the Iowa caucuses, garnering slightly less than one percent of the state delegates.[145] He withdrew from the race that evening.[146]

Despite its lack of success, Biden's 2008 campaign raised his stature in the political world.[147]: 336 In particular, it changed the relationship between Biden and Obama. Although they had served together on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, they had not been close: Biden resented Obama's quick rise to political stardom,[121] while Obama viewed Biden as garrulous and patronizing.[147]: 28, 337–338 Having gotten to know each other during 2007, Obama appreciated Biden's campaign style and appeal to working-class voters, and Biden said he became convinced Obama was ""the real deal"".[147]: 28, 337–338

2008 and 2012 vice presidential campaigns

2008 campaign

Biden speaks at the August 23, 2008, vice presidential announcement at the Old State Capitol in Springfield, Illinois.

In August 2008, Obama and Biden met in secret to discuss the possibility of a place for Biden in the Obama administration,[149] and developed a strong personal rapport. On August 22, 2008, Obama announced that Biden would be his running mate.[150] The New York Times reported that the choice reflected a desire for someone with foreign policy and national security experience.[151] Others pointed out Biden's appeal to middle-class and blue-collar voters.[152] Biden was officially nominated for vice president on August 27 at the 2008 Democratic National Convention in Denver.[154]

Biden's vice-presidential campaigning gained little media attention, as the press devoted far more coverage to the Republican nominee, Alaska governor Sarah Palin.[155][156] Under instructions from the campaign, Biden kept his speeches succinct and tried to avoid offhand remarks.[157][158] Privately, Biden's remarks frustrated Obama. ""How many times is Biden gonna say something stupid?"", he asked.[147]: 411–414, 419 Obama campaign staffers called Biden's blunders ""Joe bombs"" and kept Biden uninformed about strategy discussions, which irked Biden.[159] Relations between the two campaigns became strained for a month, until Biden apologized to Obama and the two built a stronger partnership.[147]: 411–414

As the 2007–2008 financial crisis reached a peak in September 2008, and the proposed Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 became a major factor in the campaign, Biden voted for the $700 billion Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008, which passed in the Senate.[160] On October 2, he participated in the vice-presidential debate with Palin at Washington University in St. Louis. Post-debate polls found that while Palin exceeded many voters' expectations, Biden had still won the debate overall. On November 4, Obama and Biden were elected.[162][163][164]

As Biden was running for vice president, he was also running for reelection to the Senate,[165] as permitted by Delaware law.[68] Having been reelected to the Senate as well as the vice presidency,[166] Biden made a point of not resigning from the Senate before he was sworn in for his seventh term in January 2009.[167] He resigned from the Senate on January 15.[168][169]

2012 campaign

In October 2010, Biden said Obama had asked him to remain as his running mate for the 2012 presidential election,[170] but with Obama's popularity on the decline, White House Chief of Staff William M. Daley conducted some secret polling and focus group research in late 2011 on the idea of replacing Biden with Hillary Clinton.[171] The notion was dropped when the results showed no appreciable improvement,[171] and White House officials later said Obama himself never entertained the idea.[172]

Biden's May 2012 statement that he was ""absolutely comfortable"" with same-sex marriage gained considerable public attention in comparison to Obama's position, which had been described as ""evolving"".[173] Biden made his statement without administration consent, and Obama and his aides were irked, since Obama had planned to shift position in the build-up to the party convention.[159][174][175] Gay rights advocates seized upon Biden's statement,[174] and within days, Obama announced that he too supported same-sex marriage, an action in part forced by Biden's remarks.[176]

Biden had a heavy schedule of appearances in swing states as the reelection campaign began in earnest in spring 2012.[177][178] An August 2012 remark before a mixed-race audience that Republican proposals to relax Wall Street regulations would ""put y'all back in chains"" again drew attention to Biden's propensity for colorful remarks.[177][179][180]

Obama watching Biden debate Paul Ryan in the vice-presidential debate on Air Force One

Following the first presidential debate of the general election, in which President Obama's performance was considered surprisingly lackluster,[181] his lead over Romney collapsed,[182] putting pressure on Biden to stop the bleeding with a strong showing against the Republican vice-presidential nominee, Paul Ryan.[183][184] Some political analysts considered Biden's performance in the October 11 vice-presidential debate one of the best of his career[185][186] and a key factor in Obama's rebound in the polls and eventual victory.[187][188] The debate also became memorable for the popularization of Biden's use of the phrase ""a bunch of malarkey"" in response to an attack by Ryan on the administration's response to the September 11, 2012, attacks on the U.S. embassy in Benghazi.[189][190] Biden reused the phrase during his 2020 presidential campaign.[191] On November 6, Obama and Biden were reelected.[192]

Vice presidency (2009–2017)

First term (2009–2013)

Biden being sworn in as vice president by Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens on January 20, 2009

Biden said he intended to eliminate some explicit roles assumed by George W. Bush's vice president, Dick Cheney, and did not intend to emulate any previous vice presidency.[193] He was sworn in on January 20, 2009.[194] He was the first vice president from Delaware[195] and the first Roman Catholic vice president.[196][197]

Biden visited Kosovo in May and affirmed the U.S. position that its ""independence is irreversible"".[198] Biden lost an internal debate to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton about sending 21,000 new troops to Afghanistan,[199][200] but his skepticism was valued,[201] and in 2009, Biden's views gained more influence as Obama reconsidered his Afghanistan strategy.[202] Biden visited Iraq about every two months,[121] becoming the administration's point man in delivering messages to Iraqi leadership about expected progress there.[201] More generally, overseeing Iraq policy became Biden's responsibility.[203] By 2012, Biden had made eight trips there, but his oversight of U.S. policy in Iraq receded with the exit of U.S. troops in 2011.[178][204]

Biden oversaw infrastructure spending from the Obama stimulus package intended to help counteract the ongoing recession.[205] When he completed that role in February 2011, he said the number of fraud incidents with stimulus monies had been less than one percent.[206]

Biden's off-message response to a question in April 2009, during the beginning of the swine flu outbreak, led to a swift retraction by the White House.[207] The remark revived Biden's reputation for gaffes.[208][202][209] Confronted with rising unemployment through July 2009, Biden acknowledged that the administration had ""misread how bad the economy was"", but maintained confidence the stimulus package would create many more jobs once the pace of expenditures picked up.[210] A hot mic picked up Biden telling Obama that his signing the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act was ""a big fucking deal"" on March 23, 2010. Despite their different personalities, Obama and Biden formed a friendship, partly based around Obama's daughter Sasha and Biden's granddaughter Maisy, who attended Sidwell Friends School together.[159]

President Obama congratulates Biden for his role in shaping the debt ceiling deal which led to the Budget Control Act of 2011.

Members of the Obama administration said Biden's role in the White House was to be a contrarian and force others to defend their positions.[211] Rahm Emanuel, White House chief of staff, said that Biden helped counter groupthink.[212] The Bidens maintained a relaxed atmosphere at their official residence in Washington, often entertaining their grandchildren, and regularly returned to their home in Delaware.[213]

Biden campaigned heavily for Democrats in the 2010 midterm elections, maintaining an attitude of optimism in the face of predictions of large-scale losses for the party.[170] Following big Republican gains in the elections and the departure of Emanuel, Biden's past relationships with Republicans in Congress became more important.[214][215] He led the successful administration effort to gain Senate approval for the New START treaty.[214][215] In December 2010, Biden's advocacy for a middle ground, followed by his negotiations with Senate minority leader Mitch McConnell, were instrumental in producing the administration's compromise tax package that included a temporary extension of the Bush tax cuts.[215][216] The package passed as the Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010.

Biden, Obama and the national security team gathered in the White House Situation Room to monitor the progress of the May 2011 mission to kill Osama bin Laden.

Obama delegated Biden to lead negotiations with Congress in March 2011 to resolve federal spending levels and avoid a government shutdown.[217] The U.S. debt ceiling crisis developed over the next few months, but Biden's relationship with McConnell again proved key in bringing about a deal to resolve it, in the form of the Budget Control Act of 2011.[218][219][220] Some reports suggest that Biden opposed proceeding with the May 2011 U.S. mission to kill Osama bin Laden,[178][221] lest failure adversely affect Obama's reelection prospects.[222][223]

Obama named Biden to head the Gun Violence Task Force, created to address the causes of school shootings and consider possible gun control measures in the aftermath of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, in December 2012.[224] Later that month, during the final days before the United States fell off the ""fiscal cliff"", Biden's relationship with McConnell again proved important as the two negotiated a deal that led to the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 being passed at the start of 2013.[225][226]

Second term (2013–2017)

Biden was inaugurated to a second term on January 20, 2013, at a small ceremony at Number One Observatory Circle, his official residence, with Justice Sonia Sotomayor presiding (a public ceremony took place on January 21).[227] He played little part in discussions that led to the October 2013 passage of the Continuing Appropriations Act, 2014, which resolved the federal government shutdown of 2013 and the debt-ceiling crisis of 2013. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and other Democratic leaders cut him out of direct talks with Congress, feeling Biden had given too much away during previous negotiations.[228][229][230]

Biden's Violence Against Women Act was reauthorized again in 2013. The act led to related developments, such as the White House Council on Women and Girls, begun in the first term, as well as the White House Task Force to Protect Students from Sexual Assault, begun in January 2014 with Biden and Valerie Jarrett as co-chairs.[231][232] He talked about sexual violence while introducing Lady Gaga at the 88th Academy Awards in 2016, receiving a standing ovation from the audience.[233]

Biden with Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Jerusalem, March 9, 2016

Biden favored arming Syria's rebel fighters.[234] As the ISIL insurgency in Iraq intensified in 2014, renewed attention was paid to the Biden-Gelb Iraqi federalization plan of 2006, with some observers suggesting Biden had been right all along.[235][236] He had close relationships with several Latin American leaders and visited the region 16 times during his vice presidency, the most of any president or vice president.[237] In August 2016, Biden visited Serbia, where he met with the Serbian Prime Minister Aleksandar Vučić and expressed condolences for civilian victims of the bombing campaign during the Kosovo War.[238] Biden never cast a tie-breaking vote in the Senate, making him the longest-serving vice president with this distinction.[239]

Role in the 2016 presidential campaign

During his second term, Biden was often said to be preparing for a bid for the 2016 Democratic presidential nomination.[240] With his family, friends, and donors encouraging him in mid-2015 to enter the race, and with Hillary Clinton's favorability ratings in decline at that time, Biden was reported to be seriously considering the prospect and a ""Draft Biden 2016"" PAC was established.[240][241][242]

By late 2015, Biden was still uncertain about running. He felt his son Beau's recent death had largely drained his emotional energy, and said, ""nobody has a right... to seek that office unless they're willing to give it 110% of who they are.""[243] On October 21, Biden announced his decision not to run for president in 2016.[244][245][246]

Post-vice presidency (2017–2021)

Biden with Barack Obama and Donald Trump, at the latter's inauguration on January 20, 2017

After leaving the vice presidency, Biden became an honorary professor at the University of Pennsylvania, developing the Penn Biden Center for Diplomacy and Global Engagement. Biden remained in that position into 2019.[247][248]

In 2017, Biden wrote a memoir, Promise Me, Dad, and went on a book tour.[249] By 2019, he and his wife reported that they had earned over $15 million since the end of his vice presidency from speaking engagements and book sales.[250]

Biden remained in the public eye, endorsing candidates while continuing to comment on politics, climate change, and the presidency of Donald Trump.[251][252][253] He also continued to speak out in favor of LGBT rights, continuing advocacy on an issue he had become more closely associated with during his vice presidency.[254][255] In 2018, he gave a eulogy for Senator John McCain.[256] Biden continued to support cancer research.[257]

2020 presidential campaign

Speculation and announcement

Biden at his presidential kickoff rally in Philadelphia, May 2019

Between 2016 and 2019, media outlets often mentioned Biden as a likely candidate for president in 2020.[258] When asked if he would run, he gave varied and ambivalent answers, saying ""never say never"".[259] A political action committee known as Time for Biden was formed in January 2018.[260] Biden launched his campaign on April 25, 2019,[261] saying he was worried by the Trump administration and felt a ""sense of duty"".[262]

Campaign

As the 2020 campaign season heated up, public polling showed Biden as one of the best-performing Democratic candidates head-to-head against Trump.[263][264][265] With Democrats keenly focused on ""electability"" for defeating Trump,[266] this boosted his popularity among Democratic voters.[267] It also made Biden a frequent target of Trump.[268][269] In September 2019, it was reported that Trump had pressured Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy to investigate alleged wrongdoing by Biden and his son Hunter Biden.[270] No evidence was produced of any wrongdoing by the Bidens.[271][272][273] Trump was perceived by many as attempting to hurt Biden's chances of winning the presidency,[274] resulting in a political scandal[275] and Trump's impeachment.[276]

In March 2019 and April 2019, eight women accused Biden of inappropriate physical contact, such as embracing, touching or kissing.[277] Biden had previously called himself a ""tactile politician"" and admitted this behavior had caused trouble for him.[278] Journalist Mark Bowden described Biden's lifelong habit of talking close, writing that he ""doesn't just meet you, he engulfs you... scooting closer"" and leaning forward to talk.[279] In April 2019, Biden pledged to be more ""respectful of people's personal space"".[280]

Biden at a rally on the eve of the Iowa caucuses, February 2020

Throughout 2019, Biden stayed generally ahead of other Democrats in national polls.[281][282] Despite this, he finished fourth in the Iowa caucuses and fifth in the New Hampshire primary.[283][284] He performed better in the Nevada caucuses, reaching the 15% required for delegates, but still finished 21.6 percentage points behind Bernie Sanders.[285] Making strong appeals to Black voters on the campaign trail and in the South Carolina debate, Biden won the South Carolina primary by more than 28 points.[286] After the withdrawals and subsequent endorsements of candidates Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar, he made large gains in the Super Tuesday primaries. Biden won 18 of the next 26 contests, putting him in the lead.[287] Elizabeth Warren and Mike Bloomberg soon dropped out, and Biden expanded his lead with victories over Sanders in four states on March 10.[288]

In late March 2020, Tara Reade, one of the eight women who in 2019 had accused Biden of inappropriate physical contact, accused Biden of having sexually assaulted her in 1993.[289] There were inconsistencies between Reade's 2019 and 2020 allegations.[289][290] Biden and his campaign denied the sexual assault allegation.[291][292]

When Sanders suspended his campaign on April 8, 2020, Biden became the Democratic Party's presumptive nominee.[293] On April 13, Sanders endorsed Biden.[294] Barack Obama endorsed Biden the next day.[295] On August 11, Biden announced U.S. senator Kamala Harris as his running mate, making her the first African American and first South Asian American vice-presidential nominee on a major-party ticket.[296] On August 18, 2020, at the 2020 Democratic National Convention, Biden officially became the Democratic Party nominee for president in the 2020 election.[297][298]

Presidential transition

2020 electoral vote results. Biden won 306–232

Biden was elected the 46th president in November 2020, defeating the incumbent, Donald Trump. Trump refused to concede, insisting the election had been ""stolen"" through ""voter fraud"", challenging the results in court and promoting numerous conspiracy theories about the voting and vote-counting processes, in an attempt to overturn the election results.[299] Biden's transition was delayed by several weeks as the White House ordered federal agencies not to cooperate.[300] On November 23, General Services Administrator Emily W. Murphy formally recognized Biden as the apparent winner of the 2020 election and authorized the start of a transition process to the Biden administration.[301]

On January 6, 2021, during Congress's electoral vote count, Trump told supporters gathered in front of the White House to march to the Capitol and refused to concede.[302] Soon after, some of his supporters attacked the Capitol. During the attack, Biden addressed the nation, calling the events ""an unprecedented assault unlike anything we've seen in modern times"".[303][304] After the Capitol was cleared, Congress officially certified the election results with Vice President Mike Pence, in his capacity as President of the Senate, declaring Biden and Harris the winners.[305]

Presidency (2021–2025)

Inauguration

Biden was inaugurated as the 46th president of the United States on January 20, 2021.[306][307] At 78, he was the oldest person to have assumed the office.[306][308] He is the second Catholic president (after John F. Kennedy)[309][310] and the first president whose home state is Delaware.[311] He is also the first man since George H. W. Bush to have been both vice president and president, and the second non-incumbent vice president (after Richard Nixon in 1968) to be elected president.[312] He is also the first and only president to date from the Silent Generation.[313][314]

Biden's inauguration was ""a muted affair unlike any previous inauguration"" due to COVID-19 precautions as well as massively increased security measures because of the January 6 United States Capitol attack. Trump did not attend, becoming the first outgoing president since 1869 to not attend his successor's inauguration.[315]

First 100 days

In his first two days as president, Biden signed 17 executive orders. By his third day, orders had included rejoining the Paris Climate Agreement, ending the state of national emergency at the border with Mexico, directing the government to rejoin the World Health Organization, face mask requirements on federal property, measures to combat hunger in the United States,[316][317][318][319] and revoking permits for the construction of the Keystone XL pipeline.[320][321][322]

Biden with his Cabinet, July 2021

On March 11, Biden signed into law the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021, a $1.9 trillion economic stimulus and relief package that he had proposed to support the United States' recovery from the economic and health effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.[323] The package included direct payments to most Americans, an extension of increased unemployment benefits, funds for vaccine distribution and school reopenings, and expansions of health insurance subsidies and the child tax credit. Biden's initial proposal included an increase of the federal minimum wage to $15 per hour, but after the Senate parliamentarian determined that including the increase in a budget reconciliation bill would violate Senate rules, Democrats removed it.[324][325][326]

Also in March, amid a rise in migrants entering the U.S. from Mexico, Biden said migrant adults were ""being sent back"", in reference to the continuation of the Trump administration's Title 42 policy for quick deportations.[327] He earlier announced that his administration would not deport unaccompanied migrant children; the rise in arrivals of such children exceeded the capacity of facilities meant to shelter them, leading the Biden administration in March to direct the Federal Emergency Management Agency to help.[328]

On April 14, Biden announced that the United States would delay the withdrawal of all troops from the war in Afghanistan until September 11, signaling an end to the country's direct military involvement in Afghanistan after nearly 20 years.[329] In February 2020, the Trump administration had made a deal with the Taliban to completely withdraw U.S. forces by May 1, 2021.[330] Biden's decision met with a range of reactions, from support and relief to trepidation at the possible collapse of the Afghan government without American support.[331] On April 22–23, Biden held an international climate summit at which he announced that the U.S. would cut its greenhouse gas emissions by 50%–52% by 2030 compared to 2005 levels.[332][333] On April 28, the eve of his 100th day in office, Biden delivered his first address to a joint session of Congress.[334]

Domestic policy

On June 17, Biden signed the Juneteenth National Independence Day Act, which officially declared Juneteenth a federal holiday.[335] In July 2021, amid a slowing of the COVID-19 vaccination rate in the country and the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant, Biden said that it was ""gigantically important"" for Americans to be vaccinated.[336]

In 2022, Biden endorsed a change to the Senate filibuster to allow for the passing of the Freedom to Vote Act and John Lewis Voting Rights Act.[337] The rules change failed when two Democratic senators joined Senate Republicans in opposing it.[338] In April 2022, Biden signed into law the bipartisan Postal Service Reform Act of 2022 to revamp the finances and operations of the United States Postal Service agency.[339] Biden supported the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act aimed to address gun reform issues following the Robb Elementary School shooting in Uvalde, Texas;[340] he signed the bill on June 25, 2022.[341]

The Honoring our PACT Act of 2022 was introduced in 2021 and signed into law by Biden on August 10, 2022.[342] The act intends to significantly improve healthcare access and funding for veterans who were exposed to toxic substances, including burn pits, during military service.[343]

In 2022, Biden signed the Respect for Marriage Act, which repealed the Defense of Marriage Act and requires the federal government to recognize the validity of same-sex and interracial marriages.[344]

In June 2024, Biden issued an executive action offering amnesty to unauthorized immigrants married to American citizens. The program included a pathway to U.S. residency and citizenship and was expected to initially affect about 500,000 people. It was later struck down due to a lack of legislation empowering the president to enact the program.[345][346]

In January 2025, Biden declared the lapsed Equal Rights Amendment ratified as the ""28th Amendment"" to the constitution. The declaration has no formal effect[347][348] and the National Archives has said it does not intend to certify the amendment as part of the constitution due to ""established legal, judicial, and procedural decisions"".[349]

Economy

Inflation rate, United States and eurozone, January 2018 through November 2024

Biden entered office nine months into a recovery from the COVID-19 recession and his first year in office was characterized by robust growth in real GDP, employment, wages, and stock market returns, amid significantly elevated inflation. Real GDP grew 5.9%, the fastest rate in 37 years.[350][351] Amid record job creation, the unemployment rate fell at the fastest pace on record during the year.[352][353][354] By the end of 2021, inflation rates measured by the consumer price index (CPI) reached a nearly 40-year high of 7.1%, which was partially offset by the highest nominal wage and salary growth in at least 20 years. The inflation rate peaked at 9% in June 2022.[355][356][357][358][359] The inflation rate reached 2.9% and core inflation rate reached 3.2% on an annual basis in December 2024, the last full month of Biden's term. Between December 2020 and December 2024, CPI rose 21.3% overall, with an annualized inflation rate of 5.3% throughout Biden's term in office. The inflation rate remained above the Federal Reserve's 2% target every month since March 2021, resulting in elevated interest rates to combat inflation. Average wages increased 19% throughout Biden's presidency, falling behind inflation. The unemployment rate declined by over 2% and real GDP grew 11% during Biden's term. Total household net worth increased by 28%, largely driven by stocks and real estate. The national debt grew to $36.2 trillion, with a debt to GDP ratio of 123% and a deficit to GDP ratio of 6% in FY 2024.[360][355][361]

Percentage of uninsured Americans under age 65 from 2010 to 2022. The number and percentage of those uninsured under Biden fell to their lowest levels since 1997. [ 362 ]

Amid a surge in inflation and high gas prices, Biden's approval ratings declined, with his disapproval rating surpassing his approval rating in early 2022.[363][364][365] After 5.9% growth in 2021, real GDP growth cooled in 2022 to 2.1%, after slightly negative growth in the first half spurred recession concerns. Job creation and consumer spending remained strong through the year, as the unemployment rate fell to match a 53-year low of 3.5% in December. Inflation peaked at 9.1% in June before easing to 3.2% by October 2023. Stocks had had their worst year since 2008[366][367][368] before recovering. Widespread predictions of an imminent recession did not materialize in 2022 or 2023, and by late 2023 indicators showed sharply lower inflation with economic acceleration. GDP growth hit 4.9% in the third quarter of 2023 and the year ended with stocks near record highs, with robust holiday spending.[369][370][371]

Biden signed numerous major pieces of economic legislation in the 117th Congress, including the American Rescue Plan, Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, CHIPS and Science Act, and the Inflation Reduction Act.[372] He signed the CHIPS and Science Act into law on August 9, 2022.[373] It provided billions of dollars in new funding to boost domestic research on and manufacture of semiconductors, to compete economically with China.[374] In his third month in office, Biden also signed an executive order to increase the minimum wage for federal contractors to $15 per hour. The order went into effect for 390,000 workers in January 2022.[375][376] His administration rigorously enforced antitrust law.

In 2022, Biden blocked a national railroad strike planned by multiple labor unions.[377] During the United Auto Workers strike, he expressed support for the workers in negotiations.[378] Biden joined striking UAW workers' picket line in Michigan, becoming the first president to join a picket line.[379] He refused to block a port strike from the International Longshoremen's Association in October 2024.[380]

Over the course of five days in March 2023, three small- to mid-size U.S. banks failed, triggering a sharp decline in global bank stock prices and swift response by regulators to prevent potential global contagion. After Silicon Valley Bank collapsed, the first to do so, Biden expressed opposition to a bailout by taxpayers.[381] He claimed that the partial rollback of Dodd-Frank regulations contributed to the bank's failure.[382]

At the beginning of the 118th Congress, Biden and congressional Republicans engaged in a standoff after the U.S. hit its debt limit, which raised the risk that the U.S. would default on its debt.[383] Biden and House speaker Kevin McCarthy struck a deal to raise the debt limit, the Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023, which suspended the debt limit until January 2025. Biden signed it on June 3, averting a default.[384] The deal was generally seen as favorable to Biden.[385][386]

Biden extended the COVID-19 student loan pause through September 2023, with an ""on ramp"" period that extended some of the pause's protections against credit reporting, collection efforts, and late payment fees through September 30, 2024.[387] The Biden administration's attempts to implement student loan forgiveness and relief programs have faced legal challenges from a coalition of Republican-led states.[388] Biden's plans to forgive student loan debt were estimated to cost over $519 billion,[389] and some critics called them a ""disaster"".[390]

Judiciary

By the end of 2021, 40 of his nominees to the federal judiciary had been confirmed, more than any president in his first year in office since Ronald Reagan.[391] Biden has prioritized diversity in his judicial appointments more than any president in U.S. history, with most of his appointees being women and people of color.[392]

In January 2022, Supreme Court justice Stephen Breyer announced his intention to retire. During his 2020 campaign, Biden vowed to nominate the first Black woman to the Supreme Court if a vacancy occurred,[393] a promise he reiterated after Breyer announced his retirement.[394] On February 25, Biden nominated federal judge Ketanji Brown Jackson.[395] She was sworn in on June 30.[396] By the end of his presidency, Biden had appointed 235 judges, more appointments in a single term than any other president in at least 50 years. 63% of Biden's judges were women and 60% were non-white.[397][398] Biden expressed interest in judicial term limits and a binding ethics code for Supreme Court justices.[399]

Infrastructure and climate

Biden, then UK prime minister Boris Johnson and UN secretary-general António Guterres at the opening ceremony of the COP26 climate summit in Glasgow on November 1, 2021

As part of Biden's Build Back Better agenda, in late March 2021, he proposed the American Jobs Plan, a $2 trillion package addressing issues including transport infrastructure, utilities infrastructure, broadband infrastructure, housing, schools, manufacturing, research and workforce development.[400][401] After months of negotiations among Biden and lawmakers, in August 2021 the Senate passed a $1 trillion bipartisan infrastructure bill called the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act,[402][403] while the House, also in a bipartisan manner, approved that bill in early November 2021, covering infrastructure related to transport, utilities, and broadband.[404] Biden signed the bill into law in mid-November 2021.[405]

The other core part of the Build Back Better agenda was the Build Back Better Act, a $3.5 trillion social spending bill that expands the social safety net and includes major provisions on climate change.[406][407] Democrats attempted to pass it on a party-line vote through budget reconciliation, but struggled to win the support of Senator Joe Manchin, even as the price was lowered to $2.2 trillion.[408] After Manchin rejected the bill,[409] it was comprehensively reworked into the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, covering deficit reduction, climate change, healthcare, and tax reform.[410]

The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 was introduced by Manchin and Senator Chuck Schumer.[411][412] The package aimed to raise $739 billion and authorize $370 billion in spending on energy and climate change, $300 billion in deficit reduction, three years of Affordable Care Act subsidies, prescription drug reform to lower prices, and tax reform.[413] According to an analysis by the Rhodium Group, the bill will lower U.S. greenhouse gas emissions between 31 percent and 44 percent below 2005 levels by 2030.[414] On August 7, 2022, the Senate passed the bill (as amended) on a 51–50 vote, with all Democrats voting in favor, all Republicans opposed, and Vice President Kamala Harris breaking the tie. Biden signed the bill on August 16.[415][416]

Before and during the 2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP26), Biden promoted an agreement that the U.S. and the European Union cut methane emissions by a third by 2030 and tried to add dozens of other countries to the effort.[417] Biden pledged to double climate funding to developing countries by 2024.[418] Also at COP26, the U.S. and China reached a deal on greenhouse gas emission reduction. The two countries are responsible for 40 percent of global emissions.[419] In July 2023, when heat waves hit the United States, Biden announced measures to protect the population and said the heat waves were linked to climate change.[420][421] In April 2024, he unveiled a plan to protect and restore natural water sources (3.2 million hectares of wetlands and 161,000 km of waterways).[422]

Biden protected 674 million acres of land and ocean from natural resource exploitation, more than any other president. The vast majority of the conservation came from a ban on offshore drilling in 625 million acres of ocean.[423][424]

Immigration

Yearly numbers of illegal immigrants apprehended at the U.S. southern border

Illegal border crossings at the Mexico–United States border began to surge in 2021 when Biden assumed office,[425][426][427][428] reaching an all-time monthly high in December 2023.[429][430] Throughout 2024, crossings began to significantly decline from the December record, after Biden implemented restrictions on asylum claims from migrants who cross the border between ports of entry and urged Mexico to crack down on migrants.[431][432][433] Deportations from October 2023 to September 2024 reached the highest level since 2014.[434] Biden used humanitarian parole to an unprecedented degree to mitigate illegal border crossings, allowing migrants to fly into the U.S. or schedule their entries through official entry points in the U.S.-Mexico border. Over a million migrants had been admitted to the U.S. under humanitarian parole as of January 2024.[435][436][437]

Biden visiting border patrol agents at the U.S. southern border, January 2023

In January 2024, Biden expressed support for a proposed bipartisan immigration deal led by Senators Kyrsten Sinema and James Lankford. He had previously supported the U.S. Citizenship Act of 2021, which he proposed on his first day in office.[438][439] The proposed bipartisan bill would have allowed DHS to close the border when encounters reach a seven-day average of 5,000 or exceed 8,500 in a single day.[440][441] In addition, the bill would have mandated the detention of migrants seeking asylum and undergoing asylum interviews, with those failing the process repatriated to their home countries.[442] While not addressing the status of ""Dreamers"", it would have changed immigration law to allow the children of those with H-1B visas to get work authorizations and freeze their legal ages while waiting for green cards, rather than face deportation once they turn 21, and provide additional funding for immigration judges.[443]

Former president Donald Trump announced his opposition to the legislation, calling on Congressional Republicans to oppose it; subsequently, leaders such as Speaker of the House Mike Johnson announced their opposition, halting further legislative action.[444][445] As a result of continued high immigration levels throughout his tenure, some lawmakers and pundits have criticized Biden's handling of the southern border.[446][447][448] Criticism of the bill and broader immigration policy continued to be expressed by both sides, with some liberals considering his policies too harsh while some conservatives considered them too lax.[449][450] On January 17, 2024, a Republican-led non-binding resolution denouncing the Biden-Harris administration's handling of the U.S. southern border passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 225–187, with 211 Republicans and 14 Democrats supporting it.[451] In the final year of his presidency, the Biden administration worked to extend at least 14 contracts with private prison companies to run immigrant detention centers, despite his 2020 campaign promise to end the practice.[452] In June 2024, Biden issued an executive order allowing the president to restrict the Mexico–U.S. border.[453][454]

Pardons and commutations

Biden issued more individual pardons and commutations than any other president.[455] On October 6, 2022, he pardoned all Americans convicted of ""small"" amounts of cannabis possession under federal law.[456] On December 22, 2023, he pardoned Americans for cannabis use or possession on federal lands regardless of whether they had been charged or prosecuted.[457][458] On December 12, 2024, in the largest single-day clemency act in history, Biden granted clemency to about 1,500 nonviolent felons in home confinement who had previously been released from prison.[459][460] The act generated controversy, as it included felons such as Michael Conahan, a judge involved in the kids for cash kickback scandal, and Rita Crundwell, a comptroller responsible for the single largest municipal fraud in U.S. history. The Biden administration said the offenders who received clemency ""deserve a second chance"" and were selected based on meeting certain criteria in a uniform decision.[461][462] On December 23, 2024, Biden commuted the sentences of 37 out of 40 federal death row inmates.[463] On his last day in office, Biden commuted the sentence of Leonard Peltier, convicted of murdering two FBI agents, to house arrest.[464]

Pardons of family members and political figures

Pardon dated December 1, 2024

Biden issued more pardons for members of his family than any other president.[465] On December 1, 2024, he issued a ""full and unconditional"" pardon to Hunter Biden that covered all federal offenses between 2014 and December 1, 2024. The pardon's sweeping extent was ""unprecedented"".[466] According to Reason magazine, Hunter Biden's pardon was even more far-reaching than Richard Nixon's or other ""controversial""[466] pardons:

The Hunter pardon is far more comprehensive...in that it covered not just his convictions for drug-related activities and tax fraud, but any other criminal behavior since 2014—the year that Hunter joined the board of Ukrainian energy company Burisma. It has been alleged that Hunter's job was essentially to trade on the family name and sell his access to dad. This may not have been illegal, but it does mean that the pardon is clearly designed to offer preemptive protection not just to Hunter, but to Joe Biden himself. These features make the pardon unprecedented, though perfectly in line with the president's executive powers.

Hunter had been convicted on charges related to tax and gun offenses, after which Joe made numerous promises not to pardon him. He and his staff continued to say that Hunter would not be pardoned as late as November, although internal staff discussions affirmed that the option remained on the table even as Biden said otherwise.[467][468][59] Biden and his family finalized the decision to pardon Hunter without consulting senior staff.[469] In a statement announcing the pardon, Biden said he believed his son was ""selectively, and unfairly, prosecuted"", blaming ""political pressure"" for the collapse of a plea bargain. The plea bargain actually fell apart after the presiding judge asked about its unusual construction.[62][470][471] Biden's pardon came amid incoming December sentencing dates for Hunter for his convictions and concerns about the succeeding Trump administration potentially targeting political rivals for prosecution.[469] Biden said, ""I hope Americans will understand why a father and a president would come to this decision.""[472]

On his last day in office, Biden issued pardons for more of his family members and other high-profile figures.[465] The pardons covered Biden's siblings and their spouses, including James Biden, who was interviewed as part of an impeachment probe into Biden. Others pardoned that day include former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Mark Milley, former National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases director Anthony Fauci, and members and participants in the House Select Committee on the January 6 Attack, despite many of those pardoned not having been under criminal investigation.[465][455] Biden justified the pardons by citing his concern about ""baseless and politically motivated investigations"" during Trump's second term.[473][474][475] Biden added that the pardons were preemptive and should not be seen as implying their recipients' guilt.[476][477] The pardons Biden granted to his family and other political figures had a sweeping scope similar to the one he granted Hunter, covering federal offenses the recipients committed or may have committed between 2014 and the day of the pardon.[455][478]

Biden also pardoned two other Democratic officials on his last day in office: Ernest William Cromartie, convicted of tax evasion, and Gerald G. Lundergan, convicted of a scheme to funnel money to his daughter's Senate campaign.[479][480][481]

2022 elections

On September 2, 2022, in a nationally broadcast Philadelphia speech, Biden called for a ""battle for the soul of the nation"". Off camera, he called Trump supporters ""semi-fascists"", which Republican commentators denounced.[482][483][484] A predicted Republican wave election did not materialize and the race for U.S. Congress control was much closer than expected, with Republicans securing a slim majority of 222 seats in the House of Representatives,[485][486][487][488] and the Democratic caucus keeping control of the U.S. Senate.[489][c]

It was the first midterm election since 1986 in which the party of the incumbent president achieved a net gain in governorships, and the first since 1934 in which the president's party lost no state legislative chambers.[493] Democrats credited Biden for their unexpectedly favorable performance.[494] However, the Democrats likely overperformed for other reasons, including the Supreme Court overturning Roe v. Wade and poor Republican candidate quality in many races.[495][496]

Foreign policy

In June 2021, Biden took his first trip abroad as president, visiting Belgium, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom. He attended a G7 summit, a NATO summit, and an EU summit, and held one-on-one talks with Russian president Vladimir Putin.[497]

In September 2021, Biden announced AUKUS, a security pact between Australia, the United Kingdom and the United States, to ensure ""peace and stability in the Indo-Pacific"".[498]

In February 2021, the Biden administration announced that the United States was ending its support for the Saudi-led bombing campaign in Yemen and revoked the designation of Yemen's Houthis as terrorists.[499][500] In early February 2022, Biden ordered the counterterrorism raid in northern Syria that resulted in the death of Abu Ibrahim al-Hashimi al-Qurashi, the second leader of the Islamic State.[501] In late July, Biden approved the drone strike that killed Ayman al-Zawahiri, the second leader of Al-Qaeda, and an integral member in the planning of the September 11 attacks.[502] The 2022 OPEC+ oil production cut caused a diplomatic spat with Saudi Arabia, threatening a longstanding alliance.[503][504]

In August 2024, Biden negotiated and oversaw the 2024 Ankara prisoner exchange, the largest prisoner exchange since the end of the Cold War. It involved the release of 26 people, including journalist Evan Gershkovich and former Marine Paul Whelan.[505] In November 2024, the Biden administration announced that it had helped broker a ceasefire agreement in the Israel–Hezbollah conflict.[506][507][508][509]

Withdrawal from Afghanistan

American forces had begun withdrawing from Afghanistan in 2020, under the provisions of a February 2020 US-Taliban agreement that set a May 1, 2021, deadline.[510] The Taliban began an offensive on May 1.[511][512] By early July, most American troops in Afghanistan had withdrawn.[330] Biden addressed the withdrawal in July, saying, ""The likelihood there's going to be the Taliban overrunning everything and owning the whole country is highly unlikely.""[330]

On August 15, the Afghan government collapsed under the Taliban offensive, and Afghan President Ashraf Ghani fled the country.[330][513] Biden reacted by ordering 6,000 American troops to assist with evacuating American personnel and Afghan allies.[514] He faced bipartisan criticism for the manner of the withdrawal,[515] with the evacuations described as chaotic and botched.[516][517][518] On August 16, Biden addressed the ""messy"" situation, taking responsibility for it, and admitting that the situation ""unfolded more quickly than we had anticipated"".[513][519] He defended his decision to withdraw, saying that Americans should not be ""dying in a war that Afghan forces are not willing to fight for themselves"".[519][520]

On August 26, a suicide bombing at the Kabul airport killed 13 U.S. service members and 169 Afghans. On August 27, an American drone strike killed two ISIS-K targets, who were ""planners and facilitators"", according to a U.S. Army general.[521] The U.S. military completed its withdrawal from Afghanistan on August 30. Biden called the extraction of over 120,000 Americans, Afghans, and other allies ""an extraordinary success"".[522] He acknowledged that up to 200 Americans who wanted to leave did not, despite his August 18 pledge to keep troops in Afghanistan until all Americans who wanted to leave had left.[523]

After the withdrawal, the U.S. continued to send aid to Afghanistan, remaining its biggest aid donor as of August 2024 and spending at least $20.7 billion post-withdrawal. U.S. funding has helped support the Taliban government and stabilize Afghanistan's economy.[524][525] On September 25, 2024, the United States House of Representatives passed a resolution condemning the Biden administration for the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan, with ten Democrats and all Republicans voting in favor.[526]

Russian invasion of Ukraine

In February 2022, the Russian Armed Forces under President Vladimir Putin launched an invasion of Ukraine. After warning for several weeks that an attack was imminent, Biden responded by imposing severe sanctions on Russia and authorizing over $8 billion in weapons shipments to Ukraine.[527][528][529] On April 29, he asked Congress for $33 billion for Ukraine,[530][531] but lawmakers later increased it to about $40 billion.[532][533][534] Biden blamed Putin for the emerging energy and food crises.[535][536][537]

In 2022, Congress approved about $113 billion in aid to Ukraine.[538] In October 2023, the Biden administration requested an additional $61.4 billion in aid for Ukraine for the year ahead,[539] but delays in the passage of further aid by the House of Representatives inhibited progress, with the additional $61 billion in aid to Ukraine added in April 2024.[540][541][542] Actually delivered aid often differed from announced levels and was also often delayed. The Government Accountability Office and Pentagon Inspector General found that the Biden administration seemed unaware of the pace of weapons deliveries.[543]

Throughout the conflict, Biden consistently refused Ukrainian requests to allow them to utilize weapons against Russian military targets inside Russia. An exception was granted in May 2024 for targets in the vicinity of Kharkiv for ""counter-fire"" purposes.[544][545][546][547] Biden also blocked access for some weapons systems altogether, typically citing fears of escalation, only to permit deliveries for some weapons later on.[548][549][550][551][552]

China affairs

The Solomon Islands-China security pact caused alarm in late 2022, as China could build military bases across the South Pacific. Biden sought to strengthen ties with Australia and New Zealand in the wake of the deal.[553][554][555] In a September 2022 interview with 60 Minutes, Biden said that U.S. forces would defend Taiwan in the event of ""an unprecedented attack"" by the Chinese,[556] which is in contrast to the long-standing U.S. policy of ""strategic ambiguity"" toward China and Taiwan.[557][558][559] The September comments came after three previous comments by Biden that the U.S. would defend Taiwan in the event of a Chinese invasion.[560] Amid increasing tension with China, Biden's administration has repeatedly walked back his statements and asserted that U.S. policy toward Taiwan has not changed.[560][561][557] In late 2022, Biden issued several executive orders and federal rules designed to slow Chinese technological growth, and maintain U.S. leadership over computing, biotech, and clean energy.[562]

On February 4, 2023, Biden ordered the United States Air Force to shoot down a suspected Chinese surveillance balloon off the coast of South Carolina.[563][564] The Chinese government denied that the balloon was a surveillance device, instead claiming it was a civilian airship that had blown off course.[565][566] Secretary of State Antony Blinken postponed his planned visit to China as the incident further damaged U.S.-China relations.[567][568][569] In May 2024, the Biden administration doubled tariffs on solar cells imported from China and more than tripled tariffs on lithium-ion electric vehicle batteries imported from China.[570] It also raised tariffs on imports of Chinese steel, aluminum, and medical materials.[570]

In April 2024, Biden signed the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act, which would ban social networking services if they are determined by the president and relevant provisions to be a ""foreign adversary controlled application"". The act explicitly applies to ByteDance Ltd. and its subsidiaries, which are based in China. It ceases to be applicable if the application is divested and no longer considered to be controlled by a foreign adversary of the United States. Biden had signed the No TikTok on Government Devices Act in December 2022, prohibiting the use of TikTok on devices owned by the federal government.[571][572][573]

Gaza war

In October 2023, Hamas launched a surprise attack on Israel that devolved into an intensified conflict, jeopardizing the administration's push to normalize relations between Israel and Saudi Arabia.[574] Biden stated his unequivocal support for Israel and condemned the attack by Hamas.[575] He deployed aircraft carriers in the region to deter others from joining the war,[576] and called for an additional $14 billion in military aid to Israel.[577] He later began pressuring Israel to address the growing humanitarian crisis in the Gaza Strip.[578] Biden rejected calls for a ceasefire but said he supported ""humanitarian pauses"" to deliver aid to the Gaza Strip.[579] He asked Israel to pause its invasion of Gaza for at least three days to allow for hostage negotiations; Israel agreed to daily four-hour pauses.[580] He also directed the U.S. military to facilitate the delivery of humanitarian aid to Palestinians in Gaza.[581] Biden has said he is a Zionist.[582][583] He has faced criticism for his unwavering support for Israel. Officials have urged him to take a harder stance against Israel, criticizing his administration's leniency and support despite the Israeli government's contentious offensive, which has led to significant civilian casualties and humanitarian crises.[584][585][586]

Following the killing of Palestinian civilians receiving food aid on February 29, 2024, Biden said the current level of aid flowing into Gaza was insufficient.[587] On March 3, the U.S. military began airdropping food aid into Gaza.[588] Several experts called the U.S. airdrops performative and said they would do little to alleviate the famine in Gaza.[589]

As of May 2024, Biden has continued to support Israel during the course of the war despite significant domestic opposition to American involvement in it and subsequent widespread protests. A March 2024 Gallup poll found that a strong majority of Americans disapproved of Israeli conduct during the war.[590] Beginning in April 2024, widespread Gaza war protests emerged on university campuses, denouncing Biden.[591]

On May 31, 2024, Biden announced his support for an Israeli ceasefire proposal, saying that Hamas was ""no longer capable"" of another large-scale attack.[592][593][594] The proposal, which would establish a permanent ceasefire, release all hostages, and reconstruct the Gaza Strip, was supported by Hamas officials after mediation by Egypt and Qatar.[595][596] The Netanyahu administration responded that Israel's goals regarding ""the destruction of Hamas military and governing capabilities"" had not changed and that conditions would need to be met before it would agree to a ceasefire.[597][598][599] In the first year of the war, it was estimated that the Biden administration had sent Israel at least $17.9 billion in military aid, a record.[600] In about the same period, it sent Palestinians $1.2 billion in humanitarian aid.[601] In the last week of Biden's presidency, Qatari officials announced that Hamas had accepted the ceasefire deal, with 33 hostages to be released pending Israeli approval. Biden hailed the deal, saying ""it is long past time for the fighting to end and the work of building peace and security to begin"" in a press release the same day.[602][603]

NATO enlargement

Following the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, Biden expressed support for expanding NATO to cover Sweden and Finland.[604][605] On August 9, 2022, he signed the instruments of ratification stipulating U.S. support for the two countries' entry into NATO.[606][607] Finnish ascension occurred on April 4, 2023, but opposition by Turkey and Hungary to Swedish entry led to a stalemate.[608] Biden led diplomatic talks resulting in formal Swedish ascension into NATO on March 7, 2024.[609][610] He has also expressed openness to Ukrainian entry into NATO following the end of the conflict,[611] supporting an expedited timetable in its ascension and the removal of steps such as the Membership Action Plan typically required for NATO entry.[612][613]

Investigations

Retention of classified documents

In November 2022, Biden's attorneys found classified documents dating from his vice presidency in a ""locked closet"" at the Penn Biden Center.[614][615] According to the White House, the documents were reported to the U.S. National Archives, which recovered them the next day.[615] On November 14, Attorney General Merrick Garland appointed John R. Lausch Jr. to conduct an investigation.[616][617] On December 20, a second batch of classified documents was discovered in the garage of Biden's Wilmington residence.[618]

On January 12, Garland appointed Robert K. Hur as special counsel to investigate ""possible unauthorized removal and retention of classified documents or other records"".[619] On January 20, after a 13-hour consensual search by FBI investigators, six more items with classified markings were recovered from Biden's Wilmington residence.[620] FBI agents searched Biden's home in Rehoboth Beach on February 1 and collected papers from his time as vice president, but did not find any classified information.[621] On February 8, 2024, Hur announced that no charges would be brought against Biden.[622]

Business activities

On January 11, 2023, the House of Representatives launched an investigative committee into the foreign business activities of Biden's son, Hunter, and brother, James.[623] The committee's chair, Representative James Comer, simultaneously investigated alleged corruption related to the Hunter Biden laptop controversy.[624]

On September 12, House speaker Kevin McCarthy initiated a formal impeachment inquiry against Biden, saying that the House investigations ""paint a picture of corruption"" by Biden and his family.[625][626][627][628] Congressional investigations, including by the House Oversight committee, have discovered no evidence of wrongdoing by Biden as of December 2023.[629][630][631][632] On December 13, 2023, the House of Representatives voted 221–212 to formalize an impeachment inquiry into Biden.[633][634][635]

In February 2024, Alexander Smirnov, a former intelligence informant who was prominent in the bribery allegations against Biden, was charged with making false statements.[636] Smirnov admitted he had publicized a false story given to him by Russian intelligence officials with the goal of damaging Biden's reelection campaign.[637][638][639]

Age and health concerns

Biden's 81st birthday cake

Biden was the oldest sitting president in U.S. history. His cognitive health was perceived to have declined by Republicans and some media figures,[640][641] and privately by some Democrats. Members of Biden's family and White House staffers insulated Biden from scrutiny of his advanced aging and decline in acuity.[642][643][644]

The media widely covered public concern about Biden's mental acuity after a weak performance in a June 2024 presidential debate,[641] but gave it limited coverage beforehand, in part due to harsh pushback from White House officials.[645] Biden repeatedly said he was fit to serve two terms as president,[646] but later acknowledged that he may have been too old to serve a second term.[647] Upon concluding the investigation into Biden's handling of classified documents, special counsel Robert Hur suggested that Biden would be able to present himself to a jury as an ""elderly man with poor memory"" and wrote that his memory ""appeared to have significant limitations"".[648]

On July 21, 2022, Biden tested positive for COVID-19 with reportedly mild symptoms.[649][650] According to the White House, he was treated with Paxlovid.[650][651] He worked in isolation in the White House for five days[652] and returned to isolation when he tested positive again on July 30, 2022.[653][654] On July 17, 2024, Biden again tested positive for COVID-19.[655][656]

2024 presidential campaign

Ending months of speculation,[657][658] on April 25, 2023, Biden confirmed he would run for reelection as president in the 2024 election, with Harris again as his running mate.[659] On the day of his announcement, a Gallup poll found that Biden's approval rating was 37 percent, with most of those surveyed saying the economy was their biggest concern.[660] During his campaign, Biden promoted higher economic growth and recovery.[661][662] He frequently stated his intention to ""finish the job"" as a political rallying cry.[659][663][664]

U.S. Representative Dean Phillips ran against Biden in the 2024 Democratic presidential primaries,[665] campaigning as a younger alternative who would be a stronger opponent to Trump.[666][667] Biden was not on the ballot in the January 23 New Hampshire primary, but won it in a write-in campaign with 63.8% of the vote.[668] He had wanted South Carolina to be the first primary, and won that state on February 3 with 96.2% of the vote.[669] Biden received 89.3% of the vote in Nevada and 81.1% of the vote in Michigan. On March 5 (""Super Tuesday""), he won 15 of 16 primaries, netting 80% or more of the vote in 13.[670][671] Biden lost the American Samoa contest to venture capitalist Jason Palmer, becoming the first incumbent president to lose a contest while appearing on the ballot since Jimmy Carter in 1980.[672] On March 6, Phillips suspended his campaign and endorsed Biden.[673] On March 12, Biden reached more than the 1,968 delegates needed to win the Democratic nomination, becoming the presumptive nominee.[674][675]

The first presidential debate was held on June 27, 2024, between Biden and Trump. Biden's performance was widely criticized, with commentators saying he frequently lost his train of thought and gave meandering answers.[676][677][678] Several newspaper columnists declared Trump the winner,[679][680][681][682] and polling indicated the majority of viewers believed Trump won.[683] After the debate raised questions about his health and age, Biden faced calls to withdraw from the race, including from fellow Democrats[684] and the editorial boards of several major news outlets.[685][686]

Biden and President-elect Donald Trump meet in the Oval Office as part of the presidential transition on November 13, 2024

Biden initially insisted that he would remain a candidate,[687] but on July 21, he withdrew his candidacy, writing that this was ""in the best interest of my party and the country"".[688][689] He endorsed Harris as his successor.[690][691] On August 6, 2024, Harris was confirmed as the Democratic presidential nominee.[692] This was the first time an eligible incumbent had declined to run for reelection since 1968.[693]

In the general election, Trump defeated Harris. The Senate went Republican for the first time since 2018. In a nationally televised speech after the election, Biden congratulated Trump and promised a ""peaceful and orderly"" transition of power.[694] In a January 2025 interview, Biden claimed he could have defeated Trump had he not been persuaded to withdraw from the election, despite lagging behind Trump in polling.[695][696] A YouGov poll conducted on November 6–7, 2024, found that if Biden had been the Democratic nominee, Trump would have won the popular vote by 49% to 42%. Trump won the popular vote over Harris by 49.8% to 48.3%.[697]

Assessments

A February 2024 American Political Science Association poll of historians and scholars ranked Biden as the 14th-greatest president, diverging from public assessments. The pollsters noted that Biden's ranking was unusually high for a presidency without military victories or institutional expansion, and with personal scandals such as Hunter Biden's. The experts polled generally regarded Biden's signature accomplishment as his victory over Trump in the 2020 election, which was perceived as helping to protect and restore political and institutional norms in American government.[698][699][700]

Journalist Amy Walter, editor of the nonpartisan The Cook Political Report, argued that Biden's presidency was deemed a failure by the public particularly due to frustration over inflation. Walter said that voters considered inflation the most important factor with respect to the economy, more important than the stock market, low unemployment, or household income.[701] The extent to which Biden's policies were responsible for inflation is debated by economists,[702] but according to Gallup, public perception of the economy in 2024 was worse only in 2008 and 1992, helping Trump win the 2024 presidential election.[703]

Post-presidency (2025–present)

Biden's term ended on January 20, 2025, upon Trump's second inauguration. Biden moved back to Wilmington, Delaware.[704] He later signed with talent agency Creative Artists Agency (CAA) to represent him in public engagements. CAA previously represented him from 2017 to 2020.[705][706]

At the end of his presidency, Biden designated former senior advisors Anthony Bernal and Annie Tomasini to raise funds for the Joseph R. Biden Jr. Presidential Library.[707]

On February 7, 2025, Trump revoked Biden's security clearance, ending his access to classified information.[708] The White House said the decision was part of a broader review of security clearances for former officials. Former presidents have traditionally been granted access to intelligence briefings, though such access is at the sitting president's discretion. In 2021, Biden revoked Trump's security clearance after the January 6 Capitol attack.[709][710]

Political positions

As a senator, Biden was regarded as a moderate Democrat.[711] As a presidential nominee, Biden's platform had been called the most progressive of any major party platform in history, although not within his party's ideological vanguard.[712] Biden says his positions are deeply influenced by Catholic social teaching.[713][714][715]

According to political scientist Carlo Invernizzi Accetti, Biden represents an Americanized form of Christian democracy, taking positions characteristic of both the center-right and center-left.[716] Biden has cited the Catholic philosopher Jacques Maritain, credited with starting the Christian democratic movement, as immensely influential in his thinking.[717] Other analysts have likened his ideology to traditional liberalism, ""a doctrine of liberty, equality, justice and individual rights that relies... on a strong federal government for enforcement"".[718][719] In 2022, journalist Sasha Issenberg wrote that Biden's ""most valuable political skill"" was ""an innate compass for the ever-shifting mainstream of the Democratic Party"".[720]

Biden proposed partially reversing the corporate tax cuts of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, saying that doing so would not hurt businesses' ability to hire.[721][722] He voted for the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA)[723] and the Trans-Pacific Partnership.[724] Biden is a staunch supporter of the Affordable Care Act (ACA).[725][726] He promoted a plan to build upon it,[725] aiming to expand health insurance coverage to 97% of Americans, including by creating a public health insurance option.[727]

Biden did not support national same-sex marriage rights while in the Senate and voted for the Defense of Marriage Act,[728] but opposed proposals for constitutional amendments that would have banned same-sex marriage nationwide.[729] Biden has supported same-sex marriage since 2012.[93][730] As a senator, Biden forged deep relationships with police groups and was a chief proponent of a Police Officer's Bill of Rights measure that police unions supported but police chiefs opposed.[731][732] In 2020, Biden also ran on decriminalizing cannabis,[733] after advocating harsher penalties for drug use as a U.S. senator.[734][735]

Biden believes action must be taken on climate change. As a senator, he co-sponsored the Boxer–Sanders Global Warming Pollution Reduction Act, the most stringent climate bill in the United States Senate.[736] Biden supports nature conservation. According to a report from the Center for American Progress, he broke several records in this domain.[737] He took steps to protect old-growth forests.[738] Biden opposes drilling for oil in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.[739] He wants to achieve a carbon-free power sector in the U.S. by 2035 and stop emissions completely by 2050.[740] His program included reentering the Paris Agreement, green building and more.[741] Biden supports environmental justice, including climate justice and ocean justice.[742][743][744][745] Biden called global temperature rise above the 1.5 degree limit the ""only existential threat humanity faces even more frightening than a nuclear war"".[746] Despite his clean energy policies and congressional Republicans characterizing them as a ""War on American Energy"", domestic oil production reached a record high in October 2023.[747]

Biden has said the U.S. needs to ""get tough"" on China, calling it the ""most serious competitor"" that poses challenges to the United States' ""prosperity, security, and democratic values"".[748][749] Biden has spoken about human rights abuses in the Xinjiang region to the Chinese Communist Party leader Xi Jinping, pledging to sanction and commercially restrict Chinese government officials and entities who carry out repression.[750][751] Biden has said he is against regime change but is for providing non-military support to opposition movements.[752] He opposed direct U.S. intervention in Libya,[753][211] voted against U.S. participation in the Gulf War,[754] voted in favor of the Iraq War,[755] and supports a two-state solution in the Israeli–Palestinian conflict.[756] Biden pledged to end U.S. support for the Saudi Arabian-led intervention in Yemen and to reevaluate the United States' relationship with Saudi Arabia.[252] Biden supported extending the New START arms control treaty with Russia to limit the number of nuclear weapons deployed by both sides.[757][758] In 2021, Biden officially recognized the Armenian genocide, becoming the first U.S. president to do so.[759][d]

Biden supported abortion rights throughout his presidency, though he personally opposes abortion because of his Catholic faith.[762][763] In 2019, he said he supported Roe v. Wade and repealing the Hyde Amendment.[764][765] After Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization, he criticized near-total bans on abortion access passed in a majority of Republican-controlled states,[766] and took measures to protect abortion rights in the United States.[767] He vowed to sign a bill codifying the protections of Roe into federal law; such a bill passed the House in 2022, but was unable to clear the Senate filibuster.[768][769]

Public image

Biden was consistently ranked one of the least wealthy members of the Senate,[770][771] which he attributed to having been elected young.[772] Feeling that less-wealthy public officials may be tempted to accept contributions in exchange for political favors, he proposed campaign finance reform measures during his first term.[83] As of November 2009 , Biden's net worth was $27,012.[773] By November 2020 , the Bidens were worth $9 million, largely due to sales of Biden's books and speaking fees after his vice presidency.[774][775]

Political columnist David S. Broder wrote that Biden has grown over time: ""He responds to real people—that's been consistent throughout. And his ability to understand himself and deal with other politicians has gotten much, much better.""[34] Journalist James Traub has written that ""Biden is the kind of fundamentally happy person who can be as generous toward others as he is to himself"".[121] In recent years, especially after the 2015 death of his elder son Beau, Biden has been noted for his empathetic nature and ability to communicate about grief.[776][777] In 2020, CNN wrote that his presidential campaign aimed to make him ""healer-in-chief"", while The New York Times described his extensive history of being called upon to give eulogies.[778]

Journalist and TV anchor Wolf Blitzer has called Biden loquacious;[779] journalist Mark Bowden has said that he is famous for ""talking too much"", leaning in close ""like an old pal with something urgent to tell you"".[279] He often deviates from prepared remarks,[780] and sometimes ""puts his foot in his mouth"".[155][781][782] Biden has a reputation for being prone to gaffes,[783] and in 2018 called himself ""a gaffe machine"".[784][785] The New York Times wrote that Biden's ""weak filters make him capable of blurting out pretty much anything"".[155]

According to The New York Times, Biden often embellishes elements of his life or exaggerates, a trait also noted by The New Yorker in 2014.[786][787] For instance, he has claimed to have been more active in the civil rights movement than he actually was, and has falsely recalled being an excellent student who earned three college degrees.[786] The Times wrote, ""Mr. Biden's folksiness can veer into folklore, with dates that don't quite add up and details that are exaggerated or wrong, the factual edges shaved off to make them more powerful for audiences.""[787]

Job approval

According to Morning Consult polling, Biden maintained an approval rating above 50% during his presidency's first eight months. In August 2021, it began to decline, reaching the low forties by December.[788] This was attributed to the Afghanistan withdrawal, increasing hospitalizations from the Delta variant, high inflation and gas prices, disarray within the Democratic Party, and a general decline in popularity customary in politics.[789][790][791][792] In 2023, Biden's approval rating was the lowest of any modern[e] U.S. president after three years in office.[793]

Gallup, Inc. found Biden's approval ratings to be consistently above 50% during his first few months in office,[794][795] but by August, his ratings began to decline.[796] He had a 98% approval rating from Democrats in February 2021, but by December only 78% approved of his presidency.[797][794] By October 2023, his rating among Democrats had reached a record low of 75%.[793][798] His approval rating among Republicans has been consistently in the single digits, aside from his first few months in office.[797] Additionally, Gallup noted that Biden's public support eroded each year he was in office: he averaged 49% approval in his first year,[799] 41% in his second,[800] and 40% in his third.[801] In July 2024, just before he withdrew from the 2024 presidential election, Gallup found his approval rating had fallen to an all-time low of 36%.[802]

In January 2025, an AP-NORC poll found that Americans viewed Biden's presidency less favorably than they did Obama's at the end of his second term or Trump's at the end of his first.[803] Gallup's averaged polls of Biden's presidency found that he was the second least popular president in its polling history, ahead of Trump.[804] Many members of Biden's party called on him to withdraw from the 2024 presidential election, and criticized him for initially running for a second term given his age and unpopularity after Harris lost.[805]

Gallup found that Biden had an average approval rating of 42.2% throughout his presidency, which was lower than all other presidents' except Trump's first term, at 41.1%. Biden's average approval rating in his fourth year in office was 39%. His final approval rating in January 2025 was 40%, which was low but still higher than the final approval ratings for several other presidents.[804] CNN and CBS News found Bi"

Kamala Devi Harris ( KAH-mə-lə DAY-vee,[1] born October 20, 1964) is an American politician and attorney who served as the 49th vice president of the United States from 2021 to 2025 under President Joe Biden. She was the first female U.S. vice president, first African-American and the first Asian-American vice president, making her the highest-ranking female and Asian American official in U.S. history. She served from 2017 to 2021 as a United States senator representing California and from 2011 to 2017 as the attorney general of California. A member of the Democratic Party, she was the party's nominee in the 2024 presidential election.

Born in Oakland, California, Harris graduated from Howard University and the University of California, Hastings College of the Law. She began her law career in the office of the district attorney of Alameda County. Harris was recruited to the San Francisco District Attorney's Office and later to the office of the city attorney of San Francisco. She was elected district attorney of San Francisco in 2003 and attorney general of California in 2010, and reelected as attorney general in 2014.

Harris was the junior U.S. senator from California from 2017 to 2021 after winning the 2016 Senate election. She was the second Black woman and first South Asian American U.S. senator. As a senator, Harris advocated for stricter gun control laws, the DREAM Act, federal legalization of cannabis, and reforms to healthcare and taxation. She gained a national profile while asking pointed questions of officials in the first administration of Republican president Donald Trump during Senate hearings, including Trump's second U.S. Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh.

Harris sought the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination in 2019, but withdrew from the race before the primaries. Biden selected her as his running mate; their ticket defeated the incumbent president and vice president, Trump and Mike Pence, in the 2020 presidential election. Presiding over an evenly split U.S. Senate upon entering office, she cast more tie-breaking votes than any other vice president, which helped pass bills such as the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 stimulus package and the Inflation Reduction Act.

In July 2024, after Biden withdrew from the 2024 presidential election, Harris launched her presidential campaign with Biden's endorsement. She later became the nominee and selected Minnesota governor Tim Walz as her running mate. She lost the presidential election to Trump in November 2024.

Early life and career

Early life and education

Harris's childhood home at 1227 Bancroft Way in Berkeley, August 2020

Kamala Devi Harris[a] was born in Oakland, California,[3] on October 20, 1964.[4] Her mother, Shyamala Gopalan (1938–2009), was a biologist who arrived in the United States from India in 1958 to enroll in graduate school in endocrinology at the University of California, Berkeley. A research career of over 40 years followed, during which her work on the progesterone receptor gene led to advances in breast cancer research.[5] Kamala's father, Donald J. Harris (1938–),[6] is an Afro-Jamaican who immigrated to the United States in 1961 and also enrolled in UC Berkeley, specializing in development economics. The first Black scholar to be granted tenure at Stanford University's economics department, he has emeritus status there.[7] Kamala's parents met in 1962 and married in 1963.[8]

The Harris family lived in Berkeley until they moved in 1966, around Kamala's second birthday. The Harrises lived for a few years in college towns in the Midwest where her parents held teaching or research positions:[9] Urbana, Illinois (where her sister Maya was born in 1966); Evanston, Illinois; and Madison, Wisconsin.[b][10][9][11] By 1970, the marriage had faltered, and Shyamala moved back to Berkeley with her two daughters;[12][13][9] the couple divorced when Kamala was seven.[8] In 1972, Donald Harris accepted a position at Stanford University; Kamala and Maya spent weekends at their father's house in Palo Alto and lived at their mother's house in Berkeley during the week.[14] Shyamala was friends with African-American intellectuals and activists in Oakland and Berkeley.[11] In 1976, she accepted a research position at the McGill University School of Medicine, and moved with her daughters to Montreal, Quebec.[15][16] Kamala graduated from Westmount High School on Montreal Island in 1981.[17]

Kamala Harris attended Vanier College in Montreal in 1981–1982;[18] she then attended Howard University, a historically black university in Washington, D.C.[19][20] At Howard, she became a member of Alpha Kappa Alpha, one of the ""Divine Nine"" historically black sororities.[21] She graduated in 1986 with a degree in political science and economics.[22][23] Harris then attended the University of California, Hastings College of the Law in San Francisco,[24] where she served as president of its chapter of the Black Law Students Association.[25] She graduated with a Juris Doctor in 1989.[26]

Early career

In 1990, Harris was hired as a deputy district attorney in Alameda County, California, where she was described as ""an able prosecutor on the way up"".[27] In 1994, Speaker of the California Assembly Willie Brown, who was then dating Harris, appointed her to the state Unemployment Insurance Appeals Board and later to the California Medical Assistance Commission.[27] In February 1998, San Francisco district attorney Terence Hallinan recruited Harris as an assistant district attorney.[28] There, she became the chief of the Career Criminal Division, supervising five other attorneys, where she prosecuted homicide, burglary, robbery, and sexual assault cases—particularly three-strikes cases. In August 2000, Harris took a job at San Francisco City Hall, working for city attorney Louise Renne.[29] Harris ran the Family and Children's Services Division, representing child abuse and neglect cases. Renne endorsed Harris during her D.A. campaign.[30]

San Francisco district attorney (2002–2011)

In 2002, Harris ran for district attorney of San Francisco,[31] running a ""forceful"" campaign[32][33] and differentiating herself from Hallinan by attacking his performance.[34] Harris won the election with 56% of the vote, becoming the first person of color elected district attorney of San Francisco.[35] She ran unopposed for a second term in 2007.[36]

Within the first six months of taking office, Harris cleared 27 of 74 backlogged homicide cases.[37] She also pushed for higher bail for criminal defendants involved in gun-related crimes, arguing that historically low bail encouraged outsiders to commit crimes in San Francisco. SFPD officers credited Harris with tightening the loopholes defendants had used in the past.[38] During her campaign, Harris pledged never to seek the death penalty,[39] and kept to this in the cases of a San Francisco Police Department officer, Isaac Espinoza, who was shot and killed in 2004,[40][41] and of Edwin Ramos, an illegal immigrant and alleged MS-13 gang member who was accused of murdering a man and his two sons in 2009.[42][43]

Harris created a Hate Crimes Unit, focusing on hate crimes against LGBT children and teens in schools,[44] and supported A.B. 1160, the Gwen Araujo Justice for Victims Act.[45] As district attorney, she created an environmental crimes unit in 2005.[46] Harris expressed support for San Francisco's sanctuary city policy of not inquiring about immigration status in the process of a criminal investigation.[47] In 2004, she created the San Francisco Reentry Division.[48] Over six years, the 200 people graduated from the program had a recidivism rate of less than 10%, compared to the 53% of California's drug offenders who returned to prison within two years of release.[49][50][51]

In 2006, as part of an initiative to reduce the city's homicide rate, Harris led a citywide effort to combat truancy for at-risk elementary school youth in San Francisco.[52] In 2008, declaring chronic truancy a matter of public safety and pointing out that the majority of prison inmates and homicide victims are dropouts or habitual truants,[53] she issued citations against six parents whose children missed at least 50 days of school, the first time San Francisco prosecuted adults for student truancy.[54] Harris's office ultimately prosecuted seven parents in three years, with none jailed.[55] By April 2009, 1,330 elementary school students were habitual or chronic truants, down 23% from 1,730 in 2008, and from 2,517 in 2007 and 2,856 in 2006.[55]

Attorney general of California (2011–2017)

Harris's official attorney general portrait, 2010

Harris was elected attorney general of California in 2010, becoming the first woman, African American, and South Asian American to hold the office in the state's history.[56] She took office on January 3, 2011, and was reelected in 2014.[57] She served until resigning on January 3, 2017, to take her seat in the United States Senate.

In 2010, Harris announced her candidacy for attorney general and was endorsed by prominent California Democrats, including U.S. Senators Dianne Feinstein and Barbara Boxer and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.[58] She won the Democratic primary and narrowly defeated Republican nominee Steve Cooley in the general election.[59] Her tenure was marked by significant efforts in consumer protection, criminal justice reform, and privacy rights.

In 2014, Harris was reelected, defeating Republican nominee Ronald Gold with 58% of the vote.[57] During her second term, she expanded her focus on consumer protection, securing major settlements against corporations like Quest Diagnostics,[60] JPMorgan Chase,[61] and Corinthian Colleges,[62][63] recovering billions for California consumers. She spearheaded the creation of the Homeowner Bill of Rights to combat aggressive foreclosure practices during the housing crisis, recording multiple nine-figure settlements against mortgage servicers.[64][65] Harris also worked on privacy rights. She collaborated with major tech companies like Apple, Google, and Facebook to ensure that mobile apps disclosed their data-sharing practices.[66][67] She created the Privacy Enforcement and Protection Unit, focusing on cyber privacy and data breaches.[67] California secured settlements with companies like Comcast and Houzz for privacy violations.[68][69]

Harris was instrumental in advancing criminal justice reform. She launched the Division of Recidivism Reduction and Re-Entry and implemented the Back on Track LA program, which provided educational and job training opportunities for nonviolent offenders.[70][71] Despite her focus on reform, Harris faced criticism for defending the state's position in cases involving wrongful convictions[72] and for her office's stance on prison labor.[73][74] She continued to advocate for progressive reforms, including banning the gay panic defense in California courts[75][76] and opposing Proposition 8, the state's same-sex marriage ban.[77][78][79]

After more than 20 years as a U.S. senator from California, Senator Barbara Boxer announced on January 13, 2015 that she would not run for reelection in 2016.[80] Harris announced her candidacy for the Senate seat the next week.[80] She was a top contender from the beginning of her campaign.[81]

The 2016 California Senate election used California's new top-two primary format, where the top two candidates in the primary advance to the general election regardless of party.[81] On February 27, 2016, Harris won 78% of the California Democratic Party vote at the party convention, allowing her campaign to receive financial support from the party.[82] Three months later, Governor Jerry Brown endorsed her.[83] In the June 7 primary, Harris came in first with 40% of the vote and won with pluralities in most counties.[84] Harris faced representative and fellow Democrat Loretta Sanchez in the general election.[85]

On July 19, President Barack Obama and Vice President Joe Biden endorsed Harris.[86] In the November 2016 election, Harris defeated Sanchez with over 60% of the vote, carrying all but four counties.[87] After her victory, she promised to protect immigrants from the policies of president-elect Donald Trump and announced her intention to remain attorney general through the end of 2016.[88][89] Harris became the second Black woman and first South Asian American senator in history.[90][91][92]

Tenure and political positions

Senate official portrait, 2017

As a senator, Harris advocated stricter gun control laws,[93][94] the DREAM Act, federal legalization of cannabis, and healthcare and taxation reforms.[95][96] She became well known nationally after questioning several Trump appointees such as Jeff Sessions and Brett Kavanaugh.[97]

2017

Harris with DREAMers, December 2017

On January 28, after Trump signed Executive Order 13769, barring citizens from several Muslim-majority countries from entering the U.S. for 90 days, she condemned the order and was one of many to call it a ""Muslim ban"".[98] She called White House Chief of Staff John F. Kelly at home to gather information and push back against the executive order.[99]

In February, Harris spoke in opposition to Trump's cabinet picks Betsy DeVos for secretary of education[100] and Jeff Sessions for United States attorney general.[101] In early March, she called on Sessions to resign, after it was reported that Sessions, who had previously said he ""did not have communications with the Russians"", spoke twice with Russian ambassador to the United States Sergey Kislyak.[102]

In April, Harris voted against the confirmation of Neil Gorsuch to the U.S. Supreme Court.[103] Later that month, she took her first foreign trip to the Middle East, visiting California troops stationed in Iraq and the Zaatari refugee camp in Jordan, the largest camp for Syrian refugees.[104]

In June, Harris garnered media attention for her questioning of Rod Rosenstein, the deputy attorney general, over the role he played in the May 2017 firing of James Comey, the director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.[105] The prosecutorial nature of her questioning caused Senator John McCain, an ex officio member of the Intelligence Committee, and Senator Richard Burr, the committee chairman, to interrupt her and request that she be more respectful of the witness. A week later, she questioned Jeff Sessions, the attorney general, on the same topic.[106] Sessions said her questioning ""makes me nervous"".[107] Burr's singling out of Harris sparked suggestions in the news media that his behavior was sexist, with commentators arguing that Burr would not treat a male Senate colleague in a similar manner.[108]

In December, Harris called for the resignation of Senator Al Franken, writing on Twitter, ""Sexual harassment and misconduct should not be allowed by anyone and should not occur anywhere.""[109]

2018

In January, Harris was appointed to the Senate Judiciary Committee after Franken resigned.[111] Later that month, she questioned Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen for favoring Norwegian immigrants over others and for claiming to be unaware that Norway is a predominantly white country.[112][113]

Also in January, Harris and senators Heidi Heitkamp, Jon Tester, and Claire McCaskill co-sponsored the Border and Port Security Act,[114] legislation to mandate that U.S. Customs and Border Protection ""hire, train and assign at least 500 officers per year until the number of needed positions the model identifies is filled"" and require the commissioner of Customs and Border Protection to determine potential equipment and infrastructure improvements for ports of entry.[115]

In May, Harris heatedly questioned Nielsen about the Trump administration family separation policy, under which children were separated from their families when their parents were taken into custody for illegally entering the U.S.[116] In June, after visiting one of the detention facilities near the border in San Diego,[117] Harris became the first senator to demand Nielsen's resignation.[118]

In the September and October Brett Kavanaugh Supreme Court confirmation hearings, Harris questioned Brett Kavanaugh about a meeting he may have had regarding the Mueller Investigation with a member of Kasowitz Benson Torres, the law firm founded by Donald Trump's personal attorney, Marc Kasowitz. Kavanaugh was unable to answer and repeatedly deflected.[119] Harris also participated in questioning the FBI director's limited scope of the investigation of Kavanaugh regarding allegations of sexual assault.[120] She voted against his confirmation.

Harris was a target of the October 2018 United States mail bombing attempts.[121]

In December, the Senate passed the Justice for Victims of Lynching Act (S. 3178), sponsored by Harris.[122] The bill, which died in the House, would have made lynching a federal hate crime.[123]

2019

Harris supported busing for desegregation of public schools, saying, ""the schools of America are as segregated, if not more segregated, today than when I was in elementary school.""[124] She viewed busing as an option to be considered by school districts, rather than the responsibility of the federal government.[125]

Harris was an early co-sponsor of the Green New Deal, a plan to transition the country towards generating 100 percent renewable electricity by 2030.[126]

In March 2019, after special counsel Robert Mueller submitted his report on Russian interference in the 2016 election, Harris called for U.S. attorney general William Barr to testify before Congress in the interests of transparency.[127] Two days later, Barr released a four-page ""summary"" of the redacted Mueller Report, which was criticized as a deliberate mischaracterization of its conclusions.[128] Later that month, Harris was one of 12 Democratic senators led by Mazie Hirono to sign a letter questioning Barr's decision to offer ""his own conclusion that the President's conduct did not amount to obstruction of justice"", and called for an investigation into whether Barr's summary of the Mueller report and his statements at a news conference were misleading.[129]

In April 2019, Harris was one of 34 Senate Democrats and independents to write a letter urging President Trump not to cut aid to El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras. The group wrote:[130]

We encourage you to listen to members of your own Administration and reverse a decision that will damage our national security and aggravate conditions inside Central America....Since taking office, you have consistently expressed a flawed understanding of U.S. foreign assistance. It is neither charity, nor is it a gift to foreign governments. Our national security funding is specifically designed to promote American interests, enhance our collective security, and protect the safety of our citizens... By obstructing the use of [Fiscal Year 2018] national security funding and seeking to terminate similar funding from [Fiscal Year 2017], you are personally undermining efforts to promote U.S. national security and economic prosperity.

On May 1, 2019, Barr testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee.[131] During the hearing, he remained defiant about the misrepresentations in the four-page summary he had released ahead of the full report.[132] When asked by Harris whether he had reviewed the underlying evidence before deciding not to charge Trump with obstruction of justice, Barr admitted that neither he, Rod Rosenstein, nor anyone in his office had reviewed the evidence supporting the report before making the charging decision.[133] Harris later called for Barr to resign, accusing him of refusing to answer her questions because he could open himself up to perjury, and saying his responses disqualified him from serving as U.S. attorney general.[134][135] Two days later, Harris demanded again that Department of Justice inspector general Michael E. Horowitz investigate whether Barr acceded to pressure from the White House to investigate Trump's political enemies.[136]

Harris with women of the Congressional Black Caucus in January 2019

On May 5, 2019, Harris said ""voter suppression"" prevented Democrats Stacey Abrams and Andrew Gillum from winning the 2018 gubernatorial elections in Georgia and Florida; Abrams lost by 55,000 votes and Gillum by 32,000. According to election law expert Richard L. Hasen, ""I have seen no good evidence that the suppressive effects of strict voting and registration laws affected the outcome of the governor's races in Georgia and Florida.""[137]

In July, Harris teamed with Kirsten Gillibrand to urge the Trump administration to investigate the persecution of Uyghurs in China by the Chinese Communist Party; in this question she was joined by Senator Marco Rubio.[138]

In November, Harris called for an investigation into the death of Roxsana Hernández, a transgender woman and immigrant who died in ICE custody.[139][140]

In December, Harris led a group of Democratic senators and civil rights organizations in demanding the removal of White House senior adviser Stephen Miller after emails published by the Southern Poverty Law Center revealed frequent promotion of white nationalist literature to Breitbart website editors.[141]

2020

Harris speaks at Donald Trump's first impeachment trial in January 2020

Before the opening of the impeachment trial of Donald Trump on January 16, 2020, Harris delivered remarks on the floor of the Senate, stating her views on the integrity of the American justice system and the principle that nobody, including an incumbent president, is above the law. She later asked Senate Judiciary chairman Lindsey Graham to halt all judicial nominations during the impeachment trial, to which Graham acquiesced.[142][143] Harris voted to convict Trump on charges of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress.[144]

Harris worked on bipartisan bills with Republican co-sponsors, including a bail reform bill with Rand Paul,[145] an election security bill with James Lankford,[146] and a workplace harassment bill with Lisa Murkowski.[147]

2021

Following her election as Vice President of the United States, Harris resigned from her seat on January 18, 2021,[148] before taking office on January 20; she was replaced by California secretary of state Alex Padilla.[149]

Committee assignments

While in the Senate, Harris was a member of the following committees:[150]

Caucus memberships

2020 presidential election

Presidential campaign

Harris had been considered a top contender and potential front-runner for the 2020 Democratic nomination for president.[154] In June 2018, she said she was ""not ruling it out"".[155] In July 2018, it was announced that she would publish a memoir, a sign of a possible run.[156] On January 21, 2019, Harris officially announced her candidacy for president of the United States in the 2020 presidential election.[157] In the first 24 hours after her announcement, she tied a record set by Bernie Sanders in 2016 for the most donations raised in the day after an announcement.[158][159] More than 20,000 people attended her campaign launch event in her hometown of Oakland, California, on January 27, according to a police estimate.[160]

During the first Democratic presidential debate in June 2019, Harris scolded former vice president Joe Biden for ""hurtful"" remarks he made, speaking fondly of senators who opposed integration efforts in the 1970s and working with them to oppose mandatory school bussing.[161] Harris's support rose by between six and nine points in polls after that debate.[162] In the second debate in August, Biden and Representative Tulsi Gabbard confronted Harris over her record as attorney general.[163] The San Jose Mercury News assessed that some of Gabbard's and Biden's accusations were on point, such as blocking the DNA testing of a death row inmate, while others did not withstand scrutiny. In the immediate aftermath of the debate, Harris fell in the polls.[164][165] Over the next few months her poll numbers fell to the low single digits.[166][167] Harris faced criticism from reformers for tough-on-crime policies she pursued while she was California's attorney general.[168] In 2014, she defended California's death penalty in court.[169]

Before and during her presidential campaign, an online informal organization using the hashtag #KHive formed to support Harris's candidacy and defend her from racist and sexist attacks.[170][171][172] According to the Daily Dot, Joy Reid first used the term in an August 2017 tweet saying ""@DrJasonJohnson @ZerlinaMaxwell and I had a meeting and decided it's called the K-Hive.""[173]

On December 3, 2019, Harris withdrew from the 2020 presidential election, citing a shortage of funds.[174] In March 2020, she endorsed Joe Biden for president.[175]

Vice presidential campaign

In May 2019, senior members of the Congressional Black Caucus endorsed the idea of a Biden–Harris ticket.[176] In late February 2020, Biden won a landslide victory in the 2020 South Carolina Democratic primary with the endorsement of House whip Jim Clyburn, with more victories on Super Tuesday. In early March, Clyburn suggested Biden choose a black woman as a running mate, saying, ""African American women needed to be rewarded for their loyalty"".[177] In March, Biden committed to choosing a woman for his running mate.[178]

On April 17, 2020, Harris responded to media speculation and said she ""would be honored"" to be Biden's running mate.[179] In late May, in relation to the murder of George Floyd and ensuing protests and demonstrations, Biden faced renewed calls to select a black woman as his running mate, highlighting the law enforcement credentials of Harris and Val Demings.[180]

On June 12, The New York Times reported that Harris was emerging as the front-runner to be Biden's running mate, as she was the only African American woman with the political experience typical of vice presidents.[181] On June 26, CNN reported that more than a dozen people close to the Biden search process considered Harris one of Biden's top four contenders, along with Elizabeth Warren, Val Demings, and Keisha Lance Bottoms.[182]

On August 11, 2020, Biden announced he had chosen Harris.[183] She was the first African American, the first Indian American, and the third woman after Geraldine Ferraro and Sarah Palin to be the vice-presidential nominee on a major-party ticket.[184] Harris is also the first resident of the Western United States to appear on the Democratic Party's national ticket.[185]

Harris became the vice president–elect after Biden won the 2020 presidential election.[186]

Vice presidency (2021–2025)

Harris was sworn in as vice president on 11:40 a.m. on January 20, 2021, by Justice Sonia Sotomayor.[187] She is the United States' first woman vice president, first African-American vice president, and first Asian-American vice president.[188][189][190][191] Harris is the third person with acknowledged non-European ancestry to become president or vice president.[c]

Her first act as vice president was to swear in three new senators: Alex Padilla (her successor in the Senate) and Georgia senators Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff.[193]

Senate presidency

When Harris took office the 117th Congress's Senate was divided 50–50 between Republicans and Democrats;[194] this meant that she was often called upon to exercise her power to cast tie-breaking votes as president of the Senate. Harris cast her first two tie-breaking votes on February 5. In February and March, Harris's tie-breaking votes were required to pass the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 stimulus package Biden proposed, since no Senate Republicans voted for it.[195][196] On July 20, Harris broke Mike Pence's record for tie-breaking votes in the first year of a vice presidency[197] when she cast the seventh tie-breaking vote in her first six months.[198] She cast 13 tie-breaking votes during her first year in office, the most tie-breaking votes in a single year in U.S. history, surpassing John Adams, who cast 12 in 1790.[198][199] On December 5, 2023, Harris broke the record for the most tie-breaking votes cast by a vice president, casting her 32nd vote, exceeding John C. Calhoun, who cast 31 votes during his nearly eight years in office. When she left office, she had cast 33 such votes.[198][200] On November 19, 2021, Harris served as acting president from 10:10 to 11:35 am EST while Biden underwent a colonoscopy.[201] She was the first woman, and the third person overall, to assume the powers and duties of the presidency as acting president of the United States.[202][203][204]

As early as December 2021, Harris was identified as playing a pivotal role in the Biden administration owing to her tie-breaking vote in the evenly divided Senate as well as her being the presumed front-runner in 2024 if Biden did not seek reelection.[205]

Immigration

On March 24, 2021, Biden assigned Harris to work with Mexico and Northern Triangle nations (El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras) to stem irregular migration to the Mexico–United States border and address the root causes of migration.[206][207] The Root Causes Strategy (RCS) was the product of this effort.[208] Multiple news organizations at the time described Harris as a ""border czar"",[209][210][211] though Harris rejected the title and never actually held it.[212][213][214][215][216][excessive citations] Republicans and other critics began using the term ""border czar"" to tie Harris to the Mexico–United States border crisis, including in a July 2024 House resolution, despite her having no authority over the border itself.[217][218][219][220][221][excessive citations]

Harris arrives in Guatemala City during her first foreign trip as vice president, June 2021

Harris conducted her first international trip as vice president in June 2021, visiting Guatemala and Mexico in an attempt to address the root causes of an increase in migration from Central America to the United States.[222] During her visit, in a joint press conference with Guatemalan president Alejandro Giammattei, Harris issued an appeal to potential migrants: ""I want to be clear to folks in the region who are thinking about making that dangerous trek to the United States-Mexico border: Do not come. Do not come.""[223] Her work in Central America led to creation of:

Foreign policy

Vice President Harris at a press conference at the Commerzbank in Munich with Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy, February 2024

Harris met with French president Emmanuel Macron in November 2021 to strengthen ties after the contentious cancellation of a submarine program.[227] Another meeting was held in November 2022 during Macron's visit to the U.S., resulting in an agreement to strengthen U.S.–France space cooperation across civil, commercial, and national security sectors.[228]

In April 2021, Harris said she was the last person in the room before Biden decided to remove all U.S. troops from Afghanistan, adding that Biden had ""an extraordinary amount of courage"" and ""make[s] decisions based on what he truly believes ... is the right thing to do"".[229] National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan said that Biden ""insists she be in every core decision-making meeting. She weighs in during those meetings, often providing unique perspectives.""[226] Harris assumed a ""key diplomatic role"" in the Biden administration, particularly after the Russian invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, after which she was dispatched to Germany and Poland to rally support for arming Ukraine and imposing sanctions on Russia.[230]

Harris meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at the White House on July 25, 2024

In April 2023, Harris visited Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland with South Korean president Yoon Suk Yeol and agreed to work to strengthen the space alliance between the U.S. and South Korea. ""We renew our commitment to strengthen our cooperation in the next frontier of our expanding alliance, and of course that is space,"" Harris said at a joint news conference with Yoon.[231]

In November 2023, Harris pledged that the Biden administration would place no conditions on U.S. aid to Israel in its war with Hamas in Gaza.[232] In March 2024, she criticized Israel's actions during the Israel–Hamas war, saying, ""Given the immense scale of suffering in Gaza, there must be an immediate ceasefire for at least the next six weeks...This will get the hostages out and get a significant amount of aid in.""[233]

2024 presidential election

In April 2023, incumbent president Joe Biden announced his reelection campaign, with Harris as his running mate. After the Democratic primaries, the pair became the party's presumptive nominees in the 2024 presidential election. Concerns about Biden's age and health persisted throughout Biden's first term, with renewed scrutiny after his performance in the first presidential debate, on June 27.

Presidential campaign

The 2024 election with electoral votes by state.

On July 21, 2024, Biden suspended his reelection campaign and endorsed Harris for president.[234] She was also endorsed by Jimmy Carter, Bill and Hillary Clinton, Barack and Michelle Obama, the Congressional Black Caucus, and many others.[235][236][237][238] In the first 24 hours of her candidacy, her campaign raised $81 million in small-dollar donations, the highest single-day total of any presidential candidate in history.[239] Had she won, Harris would have been the first female and first Asian-American president of the United States, and the second African-American president after Obama.[240] Harris is the first nominee who did not participate in the primaries since Vice President Hubert Humphrey in 1968. She also had the shortest general election presidential campaign in history, at 107 days.

By August 5, Harris had officially secured the nomination via a virtual roll call of delegates.[241][242][243] The next day, she announced Minnesota governor Tim Walz as her vice-presidential running mate.[244] On August 22, the fourth day of the Democratic National Convention, Harris officially accepted the Democratic nomination for president.[245]

On September 10, 2024, ABC News hosted the presidential debate between Harris and Trump in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.[246] In the debate, Trump tried to portray Harris as a ""radical liberal"".[247] Harris's sharpest criticisms of Trump came on abortion rights, where she said she would restore women's rights to what they were under Roe.[248] Harris was declared the winner of the debate by several political analysts, including columnists from CNN,[249] Politico,[250] The New York Times,[251] and USA Today.[252] Some analysts noted that for Harris, this was the ""best debate performance of her career,"" in which she forcefully highlighted her strengths and rattled former president Trump.[250][252] After the debate, Harris got a prominent celebrity endorsement from Taylor Swift.[252] However, the polls remained close and showed Harris had a hard time conveying that she could represent a ""change"".[253][254]

On October 30, Harris delivered a half-hour speech at the Ellipse in Washington, D.C., intended as a ""closing argument"" for her campaign.[255][256] Her statements about tax-funded gender-affirming surgery for transgender people in prison were attacked by Trump, who spent millions on a political advertisement that said, ""Kamala is for they/them, President Trump is for you."" Trump's campaign spent more money on the advertisement than any other in the campaign.[257][258]

Harris lost the 2024 United States presidential election to Trump,[259] conceding the next day in a speech at her alma mater, Howard University.[260] She lost the electoral college 226 to 312, and the popular vote 48.3% to 49.8%. Losses in the ""blue wall"" states of Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania were considered key to her defeat, in addition to losing the swing states Nevada, Arizona, Georgia, and North Carolina.[261] Harris's loss was part of a global backlash against incumbent parties in 2024,[262][263] in part due to the 2021-2023 inflation surge.[264][265] All 50 states and DC trended rightward compared to the 2020 presidential election.[266] On January 6, 2025, in her role as president of the Senate, Harris oversaw the certification of Trump and Vance as the winners of the election.

Post-vice presidency (2025–present)

Harris left office on January 20, 2025, succeeded by the 50th vice president of the United States, JD Vance. She and her husband moved to Los Angeles,[267] where they helped distribute food to victims of the Palisades Fire.[268]

According to The New York Times[269] and Politico,[270] Harris, who has the largest donor network in the Democratic Party, may run for president again in 2028, although her loss in 2024 could give her a disadvantage.[269] According to USA Today, Harris intended to run in 2028 before Biden's withdrawal.[271] According to New York magazine, Harris is considering her options, including running for president, running for governor of California in 2026, or retiring from politics.[272]

On February 18, 2025, Harris signed with Creative Artists Agency (CAA) to focus on speaking and publishing opportunities.[273]

On February 22, 2025, Harris received the Chairman's prize at 56th NAACP Image Awards.[274]

Political positions

Harris's domestic platform supports national abortion protections, LGBTQ+ rights, stricter gun control, and limited legislation to address climate change.[275][276][93] On immigration, she supports an earned pathway to citizenship and increases in border security, as well as addressing the root causes of illegal immigration by means of the RCS program.[277][278]

On foreign policy, Harris supports continued military aid to Ukraine and Israel in their respective wars, but insists that Israel should agree to a ceasefire and hostage deal and work toward a two-state solution.[279] She opposes an arms embargo on Israel.[280] Harris has departed from Biden on economic issues, proposing what has been called a ""populist"" economic agenda.[281][282]

Abortion

Harris supports abortion rights, and reproductive health care was central to her presidential campaign.[283][284] She has been called ""the Biden administration's voice for reproductive rights""[285] and ""the White House's voice of unflinching support for reproductive health rights.""[286] Several abortion rights and women's organizations supported her after Biden withdrew from the race, with Reproductive Freedom for All saying ""there is nobody who has fought as hard [as Harris] for abortion rights and access"" and EMILY's List calling her ""our most powerful advocate and messenger"" on reproductive rights.[287]

As of 2020, Harris had a 100% rating from the abortion rights advocacy group Planned Parenthood Action Fund, and a 0% rating from the anti-abortion group National Right to Life Committee.[288] EMILY's List endorsed her in 2015, during her senatorial campaign.[289]

LGBT rights

As California attorney general, Harris refused to defend Prop 8 in federal court, and after Prop 8 was struck down in Hollingsworth v. Perry in 2013, she ordered the Los Angeles County Clerk's office to ""start the marriages immediately"". She officiated at the wedding of the plaintiffs in the case, Kris Perry and Sandy Stier, at San Francisco City Hall.[290]

As a member of the U.S. Senate, Harris co-sponsored the Equality Act.[291]

In July 2018, Harris led her colleagues in introducing the Gay and Trans Panic Defense Prohibition Act of 2018, a nationwide bill that would curtail the effectiveness of the so-called gay and trans panic defenses, an issue she pioneered as district attorney of San Francisco.[292]

In October 2019, Harris participated in a CNN/Human Rights Campaign town hall on LGBTQ rights and pledged her support for ""all of the folks who are fighting for equality"" in cases that would determine whether gay and transgender people are protected under laws banning federal workplace discrimination.[293] Harris drew attention to the epidemic of hate crimes committed against Black trans women (at the time 20 killed that year), noting that LGBTQ people of color are doubly discriminated against.[294][295]

Harris has since been criticized for a 2015 federal court motion she filed to block gender-affirming medical care for a transgender inmate serving in a California state prison while she was California attorney general, after the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals had ruled that denying that treatment violated the 8th Amendment's prohibition of cruel and unusual punishment.[296][297]

Criminal justice

In December 2018, Harris voted for the First Step Act, legislation aimed at reducing recidivism rates among federal prisoners by expanding job training and other programs, in addition to forming an expansion of early release programs and modifications on sentencing laws such as mandatory minimum sentences for nonviolent drug offenders, ""to more equitably punish drug offenders"".[298]

In March 2020, Harris was one of 15 senators to sign a letter to the Federal Bureau of Prisons and private prison companies GEO Group, CoreCivic, and Management and Training Corporation requesting information on their strategy to address the COVID-19 pandemic, asserting that it was ""critical that [you] have a plan to help prevent the spread of the novel coronavirus to incarcerated individuals and correctional staff, along with their families and loved ones, and provide treatment to incarcerated individuals and staff who become infected.""[299]

In June 2020, after a campaign by a coalition of community groups, including Black Lives Matter, Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti announced Los Angeles Police Department budget cuts of $150 million.[300] Harris supported the decision:[301][302]

In 2020 Harris tweeted in support of donations to the Minnesota Freedom Fund, a bail fund assisting those arrested in the George Floyd protests, though she did not donate to the fund herself.[303]

Harris's criminal justice record has been seen as mixed, with critics calling her ""tough on crime"" even though she called herself a ""progressive prosecutor"", citing her reluctance to release prisoners and anti-truancy policies. In her 2009 book, Harris criticized liberals for what she called ""biases against law enforcement"".[304]

Personal life

Vice President Harris and her husband, Second Gentleman Doug Emhoff at the White House, May 2024

In the early 1970s, Harris often went with her mother to Chennai, India, where they stayed with her maternal grandfather. She learned to wear traditional Indian dress and speak a few phrases of the Tamil language.[305]

In the 1990s, Harris dated Willie Brown, Speaker of the California Assembly (1980–1995) and then Mayor of San Francisco (1996–2004).[27] In 2001, she briefly dated talk show host Montel Williams.[306]

Harris met her husband, attorney Doug Emhoff, through a mutual friend who set them up on a blind date in 2013.[307] Emhoff, who was born in a Jewish family, was an entertainment lawyer who became partner-in-charge at Venable LLP's Los Angeles office.[308][307][309] Harris and Emhoff married on August 22, 2014, in Santa Barbara, California.[310] Harris is stepmother to Emhoff's two children, Cole and Ella, from his previous marriage to the film producer Kerstin Emhoff.[311] As of August 2024 , Harris and her husband had an estimated net worth of $8 million.[312][313]

Harris is a Baptist, holding membership of the Third Baptist Church of San Francisco, a congregation of the American Baptist Churches USA.[314][315][316][317] She is a member of The Links, an invitation-only social and service organization of prominent Black American women.[318][319] Harris is a gun owner.[320]

Public image

Though the public had an unfavorable view of Harris as vice president, setting a record low,[321] her public image improved after Biden withdrew his candidacy for reelection. Notably, her approval rating rose 13% among Democrats.[322]

Harris quips, ""You think you just fell out of a coconut tree?"" during a speech on May 10, 2023.

Harris's term as vice president has seen high staff turnover—including the departures of her chief of staff, deputy chief of staff, press secretary, deputy press secretary, communications director, and chief speechwriter[323]—which critics allege reflects dysfunction and demoralization.[230] Axios reported that at least some of the turnover was due to exhaustion from a demanding transition into the new administration, as well as financial and personal considerations.[324] For most of her tenure, Harris had one of the lowest approval ratings of any vice president.[325][326][321] According to a RealClear Politics polling average, a record low of 34.8% of Americans had a favorable view of her in August 2022, but this number rose rapidly after she became the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee in July 2024. Harris had a net favorable rating by September 9.[327]

In 2024, a video clip from 2023 went viral of Harris saying ""You think you just fell out of a coconut tree? You exist in the context of all in which you live and what came before you"" at a White House event.[328] Since the launch of her 2024 presidential campaign, that and other Harris remarks have been widely shared as memes, resulting in press coverage of her public image.[329][330]

Harris's often boisterous laughter[d] has been called one of her ""most defining and most dissected personal traits"".[334] She says she got her laugh from her mother.[335]

Publications

Harris has written two nonfiction books and one children's book.

Biography

“The thing that Howard taught me is that you can do any collection of things, and not one thing to the exclusion of the other. You could be homecoming queen and valedictorian. There are no false choices at Howard.”

Vice President Kamala D. Harris was born in Oakland, Calif. She refers to her time at Howard as her “formative years” where she first was introduced to her love of politics. After earning an undergraduate degree from Howard University and a law degree from the University of California, Hastings, she began her career in the Alameda County District Attorney's Office. In 2003, Sen. Harris became the District Attorney of the City and County of San Francisco. Having completed two terms as the District Attorney of San Francisco, Kamala was elected as the first African-American and first woman to serve as California's Attorney General. In this role, she worked tirelessly to hold corporations accountable and protect the state’s most vulnerable people. In 2017, Harris was sworn in as a United States Senator for California, the second African-American woman and first South Asian-American senator in history. Harris serves on the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, the Select Committee on Intelligence, the Committee on the Judiciary, and the Committee on the Budget. On January 21, 2019, she formally announced her run for president and hosted her first press conference at her alma mater, Howard University. Harris’s historic selection as the Democratic vice presidential candidate was announced in August of 2020. Harris is the first Black woman and the first Asian-American to run for vice president on a major party ticket in the United States. Harris’s candidacy represents a milestone opportunity for our democracy to acknowledge the leadership Black women have always exhibited, but has too often been ignored. She was inaugurated as Vice President of the United States on January 20th, 2021."

""Pelosi"" redirects here. For other people with this surname, see Pelosi (surname)

Nancy Patricia Pelosi ( pə-LOH-see; née D'Alesandro; born March 26, 1940) is an American politician who was the 52nd speaker of the United States House of Representatives, serving from 2007 to 2011 and again from 2019 to 2023. A member of the Democratic Party, she was the first woman elected as U.S. House Speaker and the first woman to lead a major political party in either chamber of Congress, leading the House Democrats from 2003 to 2023. A member of the House since 1987, Pelosi currently represents California's 11th congressional district, which includes most of San Francisco. She is the dean of California's congressional delegation.

Pelosi was born and raised in Baltimore, and is the daughter of mayor and congressman Thomas D'Alesandro Jr. She graduated from Trinity College, Washington, in 1962 and married businessman Paul Pelosi the next year; the two had met while both were students. They moved to New York City before settling down in San Francisco with their children. Focused on raising her family, Pelosi stepped into politics as a volunteer for the Democratic Party in the 1960s. After years of party work, rising to chair the state party, she was first elected to Congress in a 1987 special election and is now in her 20th term. Pelosi steadily rose through the ranks of the House Democratic Caucus to be elected House minority whip in 2001[1] and elevated to House minority leader a year later,[2] becoming the first woman to hold each of those positions in either chamber of Congress.

In the 2006 midterm elections, Pelosi led the Democrats to a majority in the House for the first time in 12 years and was subsequently elected Speaker, becoming the first woman to hold the office.[3] Until Kamala Harris became vice president in 2021, Pelosi was the highest-ranking woman in the presidential line of succession in U.S. history, as the speaker of the House is second in the line of succession. During her first speakership, Pelosi was a major opponent of the Iraq War as well as the Bush administration's attempts to partially privatize Social Security. She participated in the passage of the Obama administration's landmark bills, including the Affordable Care Act, the Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, the Don't Ask, Don't Tell Repeal Act, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, and the 2010 Tax Relief Act. Pelosi lost the speakership after the Republican Party retook the majority in the 2010 midterm elections, but she retained her role as leader of the House Democrats and became House minority leader for a second time.

In the 2018 midterm elections, Democrats regained majority control of the House, and Pelosi was again elected Speaker, becoming the first former speaker to reclaim the gavel since Sam Rayburn in 1955. During her second speakership, the House twice impeached President Donald Trump, first in December 2019 and again in January 2021; the Senate acquitted Trump both times. She participated in the passage of the Biden administration's landmark bills, including the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021, the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, the CHIPS and Science Act, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, and the Respect for Marriage Act. In the 2022 midterm elections, Republicans narrowly regained control of the House for the new Congress, ending her tenure as speaker. She subsequently retired as House Democratic leader. On November 29, 2022, the Steering and Policy Committee of the House Democratic Caucus named Pelosi ""Speaker Emerita"".

Early life and education

Nancy Pelosi was born in Baltimore, Maryland, to an Italian-American family. She was the only daughter and the youngest of six children of Annunciata M. ""Nancy"" D'Alesandro (née Lombardi)[4] and Thomas D'Alesandro Jr.[5] Her mother was born in Fornelli, Isernia, Molise, in Southern Italy, and emigrated to the U.S. in 1912;[6] her father traced his Italian ancestry to Genoa, Venice and Abruzzo.[5] When Pelosi was born, her father was a Democratic congressman from Maryland. He became Baltimore mayor seven years later.[7][5][8] Pelosi's mother was also active in politics, organizing Democratic women and teaching her daughter political skills.[9] Pelosi's brother, Thomas D'Alesandro III, also a Democrat, was elected Baltimore City Council president and later served as mayor from 1967 to 1971.[7]

Pelosi helped her father at his campaign events, and she attended President John F. Kennedy's inaugural address in January 1961.[5]

In 1958, Pelosi graduated from the Institute of Notre Dame, an all-girls Catholic high school in Baltimore. In 1962, she graduated from Trinity College (now Trinity Washington University) in Washington, D.C., with a Bachelor of Arts in political science.[10] Pelosi interned for Senator Daniel Brewster (D-Maryland) in the 1960s alongside future House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer.[11]

Early career

Pelosi, her mother, and President John F. Kennedy watch as her father is sworn in as a member of the Renegotiation Board, 1961.

After moving to San Francisco, Pelosi became friends with 5th district congressman Phillip Burton and began working her way up in Democratic politics.[12] In 1976, she was elected as a Democratic National Committee member from California, a position she would hold until 1996.[13] She was elected as party chair for Northern California in 1977, and four years later was selected to head the California Democratic Party, which she led until 1983. Subsequently, Pelosi served as the San Francisco Democratic National Convention Host Committee chairwoman in 1984, and then as Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee finance chair from 1985 to 1986.[14]

Early political career

Pelosi as a member of the U.S. House of Representatives, 1993

Phillip Burton died in 1983 and his wife, Sala Burton, won a special election to fill the remainder of her husband's congressional term. She was then reelected to two more terms in her own right. Burton became ill with cancer in late 1986 and decided not to run for reelection in 1988. She wanted Pelosi to succeed her, guaranteeing Pelosi the support of the Burtons' contacts.[15] Burton died on February 1, 1987, one month after being sworn in for a second full term. Pelosi won the special election to succeed her, defeating Democratic San Francisco supervisor Harry Britt on April 7, 1987, and Republican Harriet Ross in a June 2 runoff. Pelosi took office a week later.[16][17] In the primary, Britt, a gay man, had courted San Francisco's sizable homosexual population by arguing that he would be better than Pelosi at addressing the HIV/AIDS epidemic.[18] Pelosi had held many campaign events, amassed a large number of campaign volunteers, and fundraised prolifically for her campaign.[19]

Pelosi has continued to represent approximately the same area of San Francisco for her entire congressional career, despite the boundaries shifting marginally in decennial post-reapportionment redistrictings. This area has been represented in the House by Democrats uninterruptedly since 1949, and is strongly Democratic-leaning (as of 2006, 13% of registered voters in the boundaries of Pelosi's district were Republican). It has not seen a serious Republican congressional contender since the early 1960s.[20] Pelosi has been reelected to the House 18 times[21] without any substantive opposition. Unlike in her 1987 campaign, Pelosi has not participated in candidates' debates in her reelection campaigns. In her first seven reelection campaigns (from 1988 through 2004), she won an average of 80% of the vote.[20]

At the time that Pelosi entered office, there were only 23 women in the House.[22]

When Pelosi entered office, the AIDS epidemic was at a dire point.[23] San Francisco was greatly affected; its large population of gay men was the epidemic's initial epicenter.[24] Beginning in her first term, Pelosi became a prominent congressional advocate on behalf of those impacted by HIV/AIDS.[23] Shortly after she took office, she hired a gay man as her congressional office's director of AIDS policy. In her first floor speech, Pelosi promised that she would be an advocate in the fight against what she called ""the crisis of AIDS."" With great stigma around the subject, some in her party privately chastised her for publicly associating herself with it.[18] Pelosi co-authored the Ryan White CARE Act, which allocated funding dedicated to providing treatment and services for those impacted by HIV/AIDS.[23] President George H. W. Bush signed the bill into law in December 1990.[25]

In March 1988, Pelosi voted for the Civil Rights Restoration Act of 1987 (as well as to override President Ronald Reagan's veto).[26][27][28]

Pelosi helped shape the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act, working with California Senator Dianne Feinstein and New York Congressman Chuck Schumer. It became law in 1994.[19] Pelosi also held chairs on important committees, such as the House Appropriations Committee and the House Intelligence Committee.[19]

In 2001, Pelosi was elected the House minority whip, second-in-command to Minority Leader Dick Gephardt. She was the first woman in U.S. history to hold that post.[29] Pelosi defeated John Lewis and Steny Hoyer for the position. A strong fundraiser, she used campaign contributions to help persuade other members of Congress to support her candidacy.[30]

In 2002, Pelosi opposed the Iraq Resolution authorizing President George W. Bush to use military force against Iraq, which passed the House on a 296–133 vote.[31][32] She said, ""unilateral use of force without first exhausting every diplomatic remedy and other remedies and making a case to the American people will be harmful to our war on terrorism.""[33]

First tenure as minority leader (2003–2007)

In November 2002, after Gephardt resigned as House minority leader to seek the Democratic nomination in the 2004 presidential election, Pelosi was elected to replace him, becoming the first woman to lead a major party in either chamber of Congress.[34] In the campaign to succeed Gephardt as the House Democratic Caucus's leader, Pelosi was challenged by Harold Ford Jr. and Marcy Kaptur. Kaptur withdrew her candidacy for the position before the November 15, 2002, caucus vote, and Pelosi defeated Ford 117–29 in the closed-door vote of caucus members.[35] Critics of Pelosi characterized her as too liberal to be a successful House leader.[36][37]

As minority leader, Pelosi sharply criticized the handling of the Iraq War by President Bush and his administration, in 2004 saying Bush had demonstrated areas of ""incompetence"".[38]

In a relative surprise, the Democratic Party lost three seats in the 2004 House elections, which coincided with Bush's reelection as president.[39] Focused on retaking the House majority in 2006, in her second term as minority leader Pelosi worked to criticize the Bush administration more effectively and to contrast the Democratic Party with it.[39][40] As part of this, Pelosi voiced even harsher criticism of Bush's handling of the Iraq War.[40] In November 2005, prominent congressional Democrat John Murtha proposed that the U.S. begin a withdrawal of troops from Iraq at the ""earliest predictable date"". Pelosi initially declined to commit to supporting Murtha's proposal.[41] Speaker Dennis Hastert soon brought to the floor a vote on a non-binding resolution calling for an immediate withdrawal of troops, seeking to trap Democrats into taking a more radical stance. Pelosi led Democrats in voting against the resolution, which failed in a 403–3 floor vote.[42] Roughly two weeks later, Pelosi held a press conference in which she endorsed Murtha's proposal.[43] Some critics believed that Pelosi's support for a troop withdrawal would prevent the Democrats from winning a House majority in the 2006 elections.[40]

During her time as minority leader, Pelosi was not well known to much of the American public. Before the 2006 elections, Republicans made a concerted effort to taint public perception of her, running advertisements assailing her.[44] Advertisements demonizing Pelosi became a routine part of Republican advertising in subsequent elections.[45] For instance, during the 2022 election cycle, Republicans ran more than $50 million in ads that negatively characterized or invoked Pelosi, and in the 2010 cycle, they spent more than $65 million on such ads.[45][46]

First speakership (2007–2011)

2007 speakership election

In the 2006 elections, the Democrats took control of the House, picking up 30 seats,[47] the party's largest House seat gain since the 1974 elections held in the wake of the Watergate scandal.[40] The party's House majority meant that as the party's incumbent House leader, Pelosi was widely expected to become speaker in the next Congress.[48][49] On November 16, 2006, the Democratic caucus unanimously nominated her for speaker.[50]

Pelosi supported her longtime friend John Murtha for House majority leader, the second-ranking post in the House. His competitor was House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer, who had been Pelosi's second-in-command since 2003.[51] Hoyer was elected House majority leader over Murtha by a margin of 149–86.[52]

On January 4, 2007, Pelosi defeated Republican John Boehner of Ohio, 233 votes to 202, in the election for speaker of the House.[53][54][55]

Rahm Emanuel, the incoming chairman of the House Democratic Caucus, nominated Pelosi, and her longtime friend John Dingell swore her in, as the dean of the House of Representatives traditionally does.[56][57]

Pelosi (right) with Vice President Dick Cheney behind President George W. Bush at the 2007 State of the Union Address. Pelosi became the first woman to sit behind the podium at such an address. Bush acknowledged this by beginning his speech with the words, ""Tonight, I have the high privilege and distinct honor of my own as the first president to begin the State of the Union message with these words: Madam Speaker."" [ 58 ]

Pelosi was the first woman, the first Californian, and the first Italian-American to hold the speakership. She was also the second speaker from a state west of the Rocky Mountains. The first was Washington's Tom Foley, the last Democrat to hold the post before Pelosi.

During her speech, she discussed the historical importance of being the first woman to hold the position of Speaker:

This is a historic moment—for the Congress, and for the women of this country. It is a moment for which we have waited more than 200 years. Never losing faith, we waited through the many years of struggle to achieve our rights. But women weren't just waiting; women were working. Never losing faith, we worked to redeem the promise of America, that all men and women are created equal. For our daughters and granddaughters, today, we have broken the marble ceiling. For our daughters and our granddaughters, the sky is the limit, anything is possible for them.[59]

She also said Iraq was the major issue facing the 110th Congress while incorporating some Democratic Party beliefs:

The election of 2006 was a call to change—not merely to change the control of Congress, but for a new direction for our country. Nowhere were the American people more clear about the need for a new direction than in Iraq. The American people rejected an open-ended obligation to a war without end.[59]

As speaker, Pelosi remained the leader of the House Democrats, as the speaker is considered the leader of the majority caucus. But by tradition, she did not normally participate in debate and almost never voted on the floor, though she had the right to do so as a member of the House. She was also not a member of any House committees, also in keeping with tradition.

Pelosi was reelected speaker in 2009.

Public perception

During and after her first tenure as speaker, Pelosi was widely characterized as a polarizing political figure. Republican candidates often associated their Democratic opponents with her.[60][61] Pelosi became the focus of heavy disdain by ""mainstream"" Republicans and Tea Party Republicans alike,[62] as well as from the left.[63]

As they had in 2006, Republicans continued to run advertisements that demonized Pelosi.[64] Before the 2010 House elections, the Republican National Committee prominently used a ""Fire Pelosi"" slogan in its efforts to recapture the House majority.[65][66] This slogan was rolled out hours after the House passed the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.[67] Republicans spent $65 million ahead of the 2010 elections on anti-Pelosi advertisements.[46] Pelosi has continued to be a fixture of Republican attack.[68] Ads demonizing her have been credited with fostering intense right-wing ire toward her,[69] and have been seen as one of the top factors in her unpopularity with the public.[30]

Social Security

Shortly after being reelected in 2004, President Bush claimed a mandate for an ambitious second-term agenda and proposed reforming Social Security by allowing workers to redirect a portion of their Social Security withholding into stock and bond investments.[70] Pelosi strongly opposed the plan, saying there was no crisis, and as minority leader she imposed intense party discipline on her caucus, leading them to near-unanimous opposition to the proposal, which was defeated.[71]

Blocking of impeachment proceedings against President Bush

In the wake of Bush's 2004 reelection, several leading House Democrats believed they should pursue impeachment proceedings against him, asserting that he had misled Congress about weapons of mass destruction in Iraq and violated Americans' civil liberties by authorizing warrantless wiretaps.

In May 2006, with an eye on the upcoming midterm elections—which offered the possibility of Democrats taking back control of the House for the first time since 1994—Pelosi told colleagues that, while the Democrats would conduct vigorous oversight of Bush administration policy, an impeachment investigation was ""off the table"". A week earlier, she had told The Washington Post that although Democrats would not set out to impeach Bush, ""you never know where"" investigations might lead.[72]

After becoming speaker in 2007, Pelosi held firm against impeachment, notwithstanding strong support for it among her constituents. In the 2008 election, she withstood a challenge for her seat by antiwar activist Cindy Sheehan, who ran as an independent primarily because of Pelosi's refusal to pursue impeachment.[73]

The ""Hundred Hours""

Before the midterm elections, Pelosi announced that if Democrats gained a House majority, they would push through most of their agenda during the first 100 hours of the 110th Congress.[74][75]

The ""first hundred hours"" was a play on President Franklin D. Roosevelt's promise for quick action to combat the Great Depression during his ""first hundred days"" in office. Newt Gingrich, who became speaker of the House in 1995, had a similar 100-day agenda to implement his Contract with America.

Opposition to Iraq War troop surge of 2007

On January 5, 2007, reacting to suggestions from Bush's confidants that he would increase troop levels in Iraq (which he announced in a speech a few days later), Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid condemned the plan. They sent Bush a letter reading:

[T]here is no purely military solution in Iraq. There is only a political solution. Adding more combat troops will only endanger more Americans and stretch our military to the breaking point for no strategic gain. ... Rather than deploy additional forces to Iraq, we believe the way forward is to begin the phased redeployment of our forces in the next four to six months while shifting the principal mission of our forces there from combat to training, logistics, force protection, and counter-terror.[76]

2008 Democratic National Convention

Pelosi was named Permanent Chair of the 2008 Democratic National Convention in Denver, Colorado.[77]

Healthcare reform

Pelosi has been credited for spearheading Obama's health care law, the Affordable Care Act,[78] when it seemed doomed to defeat. After Republican Scott Brown won Democrat Ted Kennedy's former Senate seat in the January 2010 Massachusetts special election, costing Democrats their 60-seat filibuster-proof majority, Obama agreed with his then chief of staff Rahm Emanuel's idea to do smaller initiatives that could pass easily. But Pelosi dismissed Obama's compunction, mocking his scaled-back ideas as ""kiddie care"".[79] After convincing him that this was their only shot at health care reform because of the large Democratic majorities in Congress, she rallied her caucus as she began an ""unbelievable marathon"" of a two-month session to craft the bill, which passed the House 219–212. In Obama's remarks before signing the bill into law, he called Pelosi ""one of the best speakers the House of Representatives has ever had.""[80][81][82][83]

Assessments of first speakership

By early 2010, analysts were assessing Pelosi as possibly the most powerful woman in U.S. history and among the most powerful speakers of the previous 100 years.[84] In March 2010, Mark Shields wrote,

In the last four months, [Pelosi] has not once, not twice but on three separate occasions done what none of her predecessors—including legendary giants [Tip O'Neill and Sam Rayburn]—could ever do: persuade the House of Representatives to pass national health-care reform. Pelosi has proved herself to be the most powerful woman in U.S. political history.[85]

Later in 2010, Gail Russell Chaddock of The Christian Science Monitor opined that Pelosi was the ""most powerful House speaker since Sam Rayburn a half century ago"", adding that she had also been ""one of the most partisan"".[62] Scholars favorably assessed Pelosi's first speakership. In late 2010, Norman Ornstein, a congressional scholar at the conservative-leaning American Enterprise Institute, opined that despite polarized public opinion of Pelosi, ""she's going to rank quite high in the pantheon of modern speakers"", declaring that the only speaker of the previous 100 years he would rank higher than Pelosi was Sam Rayburn. Catholic University of America political scientist Matthew Green opined that the 111th Congress had ""been remarkable in its productivity—in both the number of bills enacted and their scope—and Pelosi shares much of the credit.""[86] Green considered Pelosi's tenure as speaker to be among the greatest in U.S. history, highlighting the passage of the Affordable Care Act (""a measure with far-reaching implications for our nation's health care policy""). He also praised Pelosi for occasionally allowing House passage of measures that had majority overall House support but were opposed by the majority of the Democratic House Caucus. He noted that she had occasionally allowed bills to move forward in such fashion despite a high level of political polarization in the United States.[87]

In November 2010, Brian Naylor of NPR opined that:

During Nancy Pelosi's four years as speaker of the House, Congress approved the health care overhaul—widely considered the most significant piece of domestic legislation since Medicare—along with an $800 billion measure to stimulate the economy and a multi-billion-dollar rescue of the banks. It is a legislative legacy that rivals the accomplishments of any speaker in modern times.[88]

In November 2010, after Democrats lost their House majority, Politico writer John Bresnahan called Pelosi's record as speaker ""mixed"". He opined that Pelosi had been a powerful speaker, describing her as wielding ""an iron fist in a Gucci glove"" and having held ""enormous power within the House Democratic Caucus"", but noting that she had a ""horrible approval rating with the rest of America"". Bresnahan wrote that Pelosi's leadership and the legislative agenda she advanced had significantly contributed to the party's loss of its House majority, citing the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act as an example of legislation that hurt the Democrats electorally in 2010. Bresnahan also believed that, ahead of the 2010 elections, Pelosi had ""disastrously"" misread public opinion, and that Pelosi had been a poor orator.[89]

Thomas Mann of the Brookings Institution opined in 2018 that Pelosi had been the ""strongest and most effective speaker of modern times"" during her first speakership.[90]

In 2018, Robert Draper wrote for The New York Times Magazine:

During Nancy Pelosi’s four years as speaker, there was no confusion as to who was in control. Pelosi used the tools at her disposal—committee assignments, campaign donations—to establish a balance among her party’s coalitions while also reminding everyone that her job was not simply to officiate and appease...But as Newt Gingrich learned the hard way two decades ago, an autocratic speaker is a short-lived one. Pelosi’s reign was successful because she understood the will of her caucus rather than bending it to hers.[30]

Draper also wrote that ""for all her mastery of Washington's inside game, Pelosi has never been a deft public-facing politician,"" and called her a poor orator.[30]

Second tenure as minority leader (2011–2019)

President Barack Obama meets with Congressional Leadership, July 2011.

112th and 113th Congress

Though Pelosi was reelected by a comfortable margin in the 2010 elections, the Democrats lost 63 seats and control of the House of Representatives to the Republicans. After this setback, Pelosi sought to continue leading the House Democratic Caucus as minority leader, the office she held before becoming speaker. Intraparty opposition failed to pass a motion to delay the leadership vote,[91] though she faced a challenge from Representative Heath Shuler. Shuler lost to Pelosi, 150–43, in the caucus vote on November 17, 2010.[92] On the opening day of the 112th Congress, Pelosi was elected minority leader.[93]

In November 2011, 60 Minutes alleged that Pelosi and several other members of Congress had used information they gleaned from closed sessions to make money on the stock market. The program cited her purchases of Visa Inc. stock while a bill that would limit credit card fees was in the House. Pelosi denied the allegations and called the report ""a right-wing smear"".[94][95][96] When the Stop Trading on Congressional Knowledge Act (or STOCK Act) was introduced the next year, she voted for it and lauded its passing. Of representatives Louise Slaughter and Tim Walz, who drafted the bill, Pelosi said they ""shined a light on a gaping hole in our ethics laws and helped close it once and for all"".[97][98]

On November 14, 2012, Pelosi announced that she intended to remain Democratic leader.[99]

Pelosi was one of many lawmakers who called for the Washington Redskins to change their name.[100] She said it was time for the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office to step in and tell the National Football League that it could not keep its registered trademark for the ""Redskins"", a racial slur for Native Americans.[101]

114th and 115th Congress

In August 2016, Pelosi said that her personal contact information had been posted online following a cyberattack against top Democratic campaign committees and she had received ""obscene and sick calls, voice mails and text messages"". She warned members of Congress to avoid letting children or family members answer phone calls or read text messages.[102]

Pelosi greets DREAMers fasting outside the Capitol, September 2017.

At times, centrists, progressive candidates and incumbent Democrats all expressed opposition to Pelosi's continued tenure as the party's House leader.[103]

Prompted by colleagues after the 2016 presidential election, Tim Ryan of Ohio initiated a bid to replace Pelosi as House minority leader on November 17, 2016.[104] After Pelosi agreed to give more leadership opportunities to junior members,[105] she defeated Ryan by a vote of 134–63 on November 30.[106]

In 2017, after Democrats lost four consecutive special elections in the House of Representatives, Pelosi's leadership was again called into question. In June 2017, Representative Kathleen Rice of New York and a small group of other House Democrats, including Congressional Black Caucus chairman Cedric Richmond, held a closed-door meeting to discuss potential new Democratic leadership.[107] Other House Democrats, including Ryan, Seth Moulton, and Filemon Vela, publicly called for new House leadership.[108] In an interview, Rice said, ""If you were talking about a company that was posting losing numbers, if you were talking about any sports team that was losing time and time again, changes would be made, right? The CEO out. The coach would be out and there would be a new strategy put in place.""[108] In a press conference, Pelosi defended her leadership, saying, ""I respect any opinion that my members have but my decision about how long I stay is not up to them.""[108] When asked specifically why she should stay on as House minority leader after numerous Democratic seats were lost, she responded, ""Well, I'm a master legislator. I am a strategic, politically astute leader. My leadership is recognized by many around the country, and that is why I'm able to attract the support that I do.""[109]

In November 2017, after Pelosi called for John Conyers's resignation over allegations of harassment, she convened the first in a series of planned meetings on strategies to address reforming workplace policies in the wake of national attention to sexual harassment. She said Congress had ""a moral duty to the brave women and men coming forward to seize this moment and demonstrate real, effective leadership to foster a climate of respect and dignity in the workplace"".[110]

In February 2018, Pelosi sent a letter to Speaker Paul Ryan about the proposed public release of a memo prepared by Republican staff at the direction of House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes. The memo attacked the Federal Bureau of Investigation for its investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections. Pelosi said the FBI and the Department of Justice had warned Nunes and Ryan that the memo was inaccurate and that its release could threaten national security by disclosing federal surveillance methods. She added that Republicans were engaged in a ""cover-up campaign"" to protect Trump: ""House Republicans' pattern of obstruction and cover-up to hide the truth about the Trump-Russia scandal represents a threat to our intelligence and our national security. The GOP has led a partisan effort to distort intelligence and discredit the U.S. law enforcement and intelligence communities.""[111] She charged Nunes with ""deliberately dishonest actions"" and called for his immediate removal from his position.[112]

In February 2018, Pelosi broke the record for longest House speech using the ""magic minute"" custom when she spent more than eight hours recounting stories from DREAMers—people brought to the United States as minors by undocumented immigrants—to object to a budget deal that would raise spending caps without addressing the future of DACA recipients, who were at risk of deportation by the Trump administration.[113][114][115]

In May 2018, after the White House invited two Republicans and no Democrats to a Department of Justice briefing on an FBI informant who had made contact with the Trump campaign,[116] Pelosi and Schumer sent a letter to Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and FBI director Wray calling for ""a bipartisan Gang of Eight briefing that involves congressional leadership from both chambers"".[117]

In August 2018, Pelosi called for Duncan D. Hunter's resignation after his indictment on charges of misusing at least $250,000 in campaign funds, saying the charges were ""evidence of the rampant culture of corruption among Republicans in Washington today"".[118]

In April 2018, Peter Beinart wrote in The Atlantic that Pelosi had been ""the most effective congressional leader of modern times—and, not coincidentally, the most vilified.""[90]

Second speakership (2019–2023)

Official painting, 2022

In the 2018 elections, the Democrats recaptured a House majority, gaining 41 seats. This was the party's largest gain in the House since the 1974 post-Watergate elections.[119][120] On November 28, House Democrats nominated Pelosi to once again serve as speaker.[121] She was reelected to the speakership at the start of the 116th Congress on January 3, 2019. Pelosi ""clinched the speakership after weeks of whittling down opposition from some fellow Democrats seeking a new generation of leadership. The deal to win over holdouts put an expiration date on her tenure: she promised not to stay more than four years in the job"". 220 House Democrats voted for Pelosi as Speaker and 15 for someone else or no one.[122]

On February 4, 2020, at the conclusion of Trump's State of the Union address, Pelosi tore up her official copy of it.[123] Her stated reason for doing so was ""because it was a courteous thing to do considering the alternatives. It was a such a dirty speech"".[124] Trump and other Republicans criticized her for this.[125][126]

In December 2021, Pelosi announced her candidacy for reelection to the House in 2022.[127] In 2018, and again in 2020, she had agreed not to stay on as speaker beyond January 2023, but otherwise avoided questions about her future.[128] In 2022, Pelosi was reelected, but the Democratic Party lost the House majority.[129] Ten days later, she announced that she would not seek a Democratic leadership post in the next Congress.[130][131]

2018–2019 government shutdown

President Donald Trump meets with Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer on December 11, 2018, saying ""I will be the one to shut it down.""

At the start of the 116th Congress, Pelosi opposed Trump's attempts to use the 2018–2019 federal government shutdown (which she called a ""hostage-taking"" of civil servants) as leverage to build a substantial wall on the U.S.-Mexico border.[132] She declined to allow Trump to give the State of the Union Address in the House chamber while the shutdown was ongoing.[133][134] After several polls showed Trump's popularity sharply falling due to the shutdown, on January 25, 2019, Trump signed a stopgap bill to reopen the government without any concessions regarding a border wall for three weeks to allow negotiations on an appropriations bill. But he reiterated his demand for border wall funding and said he would shut the government down again or declare a national emergency and use military funding to build the wall if Congress did not appropriate the funds by February 15.[135]

On February 15, Trump declared a national emergency in order to bypass Congress, after being unsatisfied with a bipartisan bill that had passed the House and Senate the day before.[136]

Congressional leaders in January 2020

Impeachments of President Trump

On September 29, 2019, Pelosi announced the launch of an impeachment inquiry against Trump.[137] On December 5, 2019, after the inquiry had taken place, Pelosi authorized the Judiciary Committee to begin drafting articles of impeachment.[138] After hearings were held,[139] two articles of impeachment were announced on December 10.[140] The House of Representatives approved both articles on December 18, thereby formally impeaching Trump.[141]

Pelosi signs the article of impeachment for the second impeachment of Donald Trump on January 13, 2021.

The day after the January 6 United States Capitol attack, Pelosi demanded that Trump either resign or be removed from office through the clauses of section four the Twenty-Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution, threatening impeachment if this did not happen.[142] On January 10, she issued a 24-hour ultimatum to Vice President Mike Pence, that if he did not invoke the 25th amendment, she would proceed with legislation to impeach Trump.[143] On January 13, the House voted to impeach Trump a second time.[144]

COVID-19 pandemic and response

Pelosi delivers remarks on the American Rescue Plan in March 2021.

Pelosi facilitated passage of the CARES Act.[145] She attracted controversy when footage emerged in early September 2020 of her visiting a hair salon in San Francisco. This was contrary to regulations enforced at that time preventing service indoors.[146] Criticized for hypocrisy by Trump and the owners of the salon, Pelosi described the situation as ""clearly a setup"". Her stylist and other Democrats defended her.[147]

Infrastructure bill

Pelosi played a key role in the 2021 passage of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act.

The New York Times credited the legislation's passage to Pelosi's decision to adopt a Congressional Black Caucus proposal to pair together the final vote on the bill with a good-faith vote on the rules governing debate on a subsequent social safety net bill. The Times noted that Pelosi did not make herself the public face of this, instead having Congressional Black Caucus Chairwoman Joyce Beatty persuade House Democratic Caucus members to accept the proposal. The New York Times wrote, ""in effect, the speaker had harnessed one faction of her unruly Democrats to win over two others.""[148] Chris Cillizza of CNN wrote:

Consider the challenge Pelosi faced with this infrastructure bill—starting with the fact that she had only a three-seat majority, meaning that even a handful of renegade Democrats could scuttle the entire thing. Then add in the total lack of trust not only between House liberals and Senate moderates but also the decided lack of trust between House liberals and House moderates. And sprinkle in the fact that the entire bill had been at an impasse for months as both sides of the party wrangled for leverage on the broader $1.75 trillion social safety net legislation.[148]

Other notable legislation

During the 117th Congress, the CHIPS and Science Act, Inflation Reduction Act, and Honoring our PACT Act of 2022 (PACT Act) were passed.[149]

Assessments of second speakership

As with her first tenure, experts gave Pelosi's second tenure as speaker high marks, with many opining that during her two tenures as speaker she had been among the most effective individuals to hold the position.

In June 2019, Brent Budowsky opined in The Hill that Pelosi had been ""the most important, consequential and effective Speaker since Tip O'Neill"" as well as ""one of the greatest Speakers who ever served.""[150] In January 2020, on the eve of Trump's first impeachment trial before the U.S. Senate, Washington Post political writer Paul Kane called Pelosi the most powerful House speaker in at least 25 years, noting that some historians were comparing her influence to that of former speaker Sam Rayburn.[151] In 2021, former Republican speaker John Boehner opined that Pelosi had been the most powerful House speaker in U.S. history.[152]

In November 2022, Chris Cillizza wrote that Pelosi was ""the most effective speaker ever.""[148] Johnathan Bernstein opined for The Washington Post and Bloomberg News that Pelosi was ""the greatest speaker in history.""[153] Jackie Calmes of the Los Angeles Times shared the same opinion.[154] Sarah Ferris of Politico called Pelosi ""a legislative giant regarded as one of the most powerful speakers in modern U.S. history.""[155] Historian Lindsay M. Chervinsky wrote for NBC News that Pelosi was ""one of the most effective speakers in history"" and had been so while facing ""the double standards that apply to powerful women.""[149]

John Haduk wrote for the Brookings Institution:

Whether you agree with her politics or not, it is undeniable that [Pelosi] has been a remarkably effective House leader. That success has come as both House Minority Leader and as Speaker of the House. As Speaker, she has worked with a majority as large as 81 seats in November and December 2009 (258–177) and one as small as 6 seats from April to May 2021 (218–212).[156]

A number of progressive and liberal-leaning outlets published strong assessments of Pelosi's tenure. Harold Meyerson opined that Pelosi had been the greatest speaker in U.S. history in an article in The American Prospect.[157] Amanda Marcotte of Salon.com opined that Pelosi was the greatest speaker of all time, calling her ""both the most effective and most progressive House speaker of all time."" Marcotte added that Pelosi had been effective ""both in terms of managing an unruly caucus and being able to push her party in more progressive directions.""[158]

Post-Democratic leadership (2023–present)

On November 29, 2022, the Steering and Policy Committee of the House Democratic Caucus honorarily named Pelosi ""speaker emerita"" in the upcoming 118th U.S. Congress.[159][160] Her second speakership, and her participation in the House Democratic Party leadership, concluded on January 3, 2023, at the end of the 117th Congress.[161]

Amid concerns about President Biden's reelection prospects in the 2024 presidential election, Pelosi played a key role in the effort to pressure him to withdraw his candidacy before the Democratic National Convention.[162] She personally warned Biden that she feared his faltering candidacy might not only result in Trump's victory but also have a coattail effect that could bring Democrats defeat in the coinciding House and Senate elections and give Republicans a government trifecta. When Democratic members of Congress privately sought her guidance on how to handle their concerns, Pelosi advised them ""speak their conscience"". On the July 10 edition of MSNBC’s Morning Joe, Pelosi said the party encouraged Biden to make the decision because time was running out.[163] Later that day, Pelosi's office stated: ""Speaker Pelosi fully supports whatever President Biden decides to do. We must turn our attention to why this race is so important: Donald Trump would be a disaster for our country and our democracy.""[164] The growing number of members of Congress calling for Biden to withdraw heightened the pressure on him.[165][166][167] Biden withdrew his candidacy on July 21 and endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris as the party's presidential nominee.[168] Before Biden withdrew, Pelosi had expressed to other California congressional Democrats her belief that the possible selection of a new nominee should be done competitively through an ""open process"".[169] She briefly held off from endorsing Harris's candidacy[170] before doing so the next day.[171] Although Harris did not win any primary elections, Pelosi insisted that the process that led to Harris's nomination was a ""primary"". She told Semafor on September 18 that Harris earned her nomination because ""We had an open primary, and she won it. Nobody else got in the race.""[172][173] After Harris lost to Trump, Pelosi blamed Biden's late exit from the race and the lack of an open Democratic primary.[174]

Committee assignments and caucus memberships

In the House, Pelosi served on the Appropriations and Intelligence Committees and was the ranking member on the latter until her election as minority leader.[175] She is a member of the House Baltic Caucus and the Congressional Equality Caucus.[176][177]

Role as a Democratic Party fundraiser

Early in her political career, Pelosi established herself as a prominent fundraiser in the party.[30] She was one of the party's most prolific fundraisers, transferring significant funds to committees for other candidates.[178][179] During the 2000 and 2002 election cycles, among members of Congress, she contributed the most money to other congressional campaigns.[180] In 2006, Pelosi was the Democratic Party's third-largest fundraiser, behind former first couple Bill and Hillary Clinton.[44] From 2003 to 2014, Pelosi raised more than $400 million in campaign funds.[179]

Political positions

Pelosi was a founding member of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, which she left in 2003 after being elected House minority leader.[181] She is still widely considered a liberal.[182][183]

Civil liberties and human rights

In 2001, she voted in favor of the USA Patriot Act, but voted against reauthorization of certain provisions in 2005.[184] She voted against a Constitutional amendment banning flag-burning.[185]

Immigration

Pelosi voted against the Secure Fence Act of 2006.[186]

In June 2018, Pelosi visited a federal facility used to detain migrant children separated from their parents and subsequently called for the resignation of Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen.[187] In July, Pelosi characterized the compromise immigration bill by the Republicans as a ""deal with the devil"" and said she had not had conversations with House Speaker Ryan about a legislative solution to the separation of families at the southern border.[188]

In April 2021, after southern border crossings peaked, House Republicans criticized Pelosi for saying that immigration under the Biden administration was ""on a good path"". U.S. Customs and Border Protection reported that nearly 19,000 unaccompanied minors arrived in March.[189]

LGBT rights

Pelosi has long supported LGBT rights. In 1996, she voted against the Defense of Marriage Act,[190] and in 2004 and 2006, she voted against the proposed Federal Marriage Amendment, which would amend the United States Constitution to define marriage federally as being between one man and one woman, thereby overriding states' individual rights to legalize same-sex marriage.[191][192][193] When the Supreme Court of California overturned the state's ban on marriage between same-sex couples in 2008, Pelosi released a statement welcoming the ""historic decision"". She also indirectly voiced her opposition to California Proposition 8, a successful 2008 state ballot initiative which defined marriage in California as a union between one man and one woman.[194]

In 2012, Pelosi said her position on LGBT rights such as same-sex marriage grows from and reflects her Catholic faith; it also places her at odds with Catholic doctrine, which defines marriage as a union between one man and one woman. She said: ""My religion compels me—and I love it for it—to be against discrimination of any kind in our country, and I consider [the ban on gay marriage] a form of discrimination. I think it's unconstitutional on top of that.""[195]

Pelosi supports the Equality Act, a bill that would expand the federal Civil Rights Act of 1964 to ban discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity. In 2019, she spoke in Congress in favor of the bill and called for ending discrimination against LGBT people. Pelosi also opposed Trump's transgender military ban.[196]

Marijuana

Pelosi supports reform in marijuana laws, although NORML's deputy director Paul Armentano said she and other members of Congress had not done anything to change the laws.[197] She also supports use of medical marijuana.[198]

PRISM

As of 2014, Pelosi supported the Bush/Obama NSA surveillance program PRISM.[199]

Removal from the Capitol of art depicting Confederates

Capitol workers remove the portrait of former House Speaker Howell Cobb of Georgia from a wall in the Speakers Lobby of the U.S. Capitol.

Pelosi repeatedly criticized the fact that the United States Capitol exhibited artworks depicting people who in various capacities supported the Confederacy in the American Civil War.[200][201][202] In 2017, this included at least 10 statues in the National Statuary Hall Collection, either in the National Statuary Hall itself or some less prominent Capitol rooms.[201] Almost all the statues in that collection were selected and donated by the states (two from each state) and could only be exchanged for others by an ordered process involving the consent of the states' legislatures and governors, but the speaker of the House directly could influence their precise placement.

During her first tenure as speaker, Pelosi moved the statue of Robert E. Lee from the National Statuary Hall of the U.S. Capitol to the Capitol crypt.[200] In August 2017, she supported an initiative by Senator Cory Booker to have Confederate monuments and memorials removed from the Capitol Building by means of legislation.[201]

In June 2020, following the nationwide protests over the murder of George Floyd, Pelosi pushed for the removal of all statues of Confederates from the Capitol. On June 18, Pelosi also ordered that four paintings of former Confederates in the Capitol Speaker's Gallery be taken down.[202] ""We didn't know about this until we were taking inventory of the statues and the curator told us that there were four paintings of Speakers in the Capitol of the United States, four Speakers who had served in the Confederacy"", Pelosi told reporters.[202]

Waterboarding

In 2002, while Pelosi was the ranking member of the House Intelligence Committee, she was briefed on the ongoing use of ""enhanced interrogation techniques"", including waterboarding, authorized for a captured terrorist, Abu Zubaydah.[203][204][205] After the briefing, Pelosi said she ""was assured by lawyers with the CIA and the Department of Justice that the methods were legal"".[206] Two unnamed former Bush administration officials say the briefing was detailed and graphic, and at the time she did not raise substantial objections.[207] One unnamed U.S. official present during the early briefings said, ""In fairness, the environment was different then because we were closer to September 11 and people were still in a panic. But there was no objecting, no hand-wringing. The attitude was, 'We don't care what you do to those guys as long as you get the information you need to protect the American people.'""[208]

These techniques later became controversial, and in 2007 Pelosi's office said she had protested their use at the time, and she concurred with objections raised by Democratic colleague Jane Harman in a letter to the CIA in early 2003.[209] Subsequently, several leading Democratic lawmakers in the House signed a letter on June 26, 2009, alleging CIA Director Leon Panetta had asserted that the CIA misled Congress for a ""number of years"" spanning back to 2001, casting clouds on the controversy.[210] The letter, lawmakers and the CIA all providing no details, and the circumstances surrounding the allegations, make it hard to assess the claims and counterclaims of both sides.[211]

Officials in Congress say her ability to challenge the practices may have been hampered by strict rules of secrecy that prohibited her from taking notes or consulting legal experts or members of her own staffs.[212] In an April 2009 press conference, Pelosi said: ""In that or any other briefing ... we were not, and I repeat, were not told that waterboarding or any of these other enhanced interrogation techniques were used. What they did tell us is that they had some legislative counsel—the Office of Legislative Counsel opinions that they could be used, but not that they would. And they further [...] the point was that if and when they would be used, they would brief Congress at that time.""[203][213]

Economy

Fiscal policy

Pelosi at the Tax March in San Francisco, April 2017

Pelosi voted against the 1995 Balanced Budget Proposed Constitutional Amendment, which passed the House by a 300–132 vote, but fell two votes short of the 2/3 supermajority required in the Senate (with 65 senators voting in favor).[214]

As Speaker of the House, she spearheaded the Fair Minimum Wage Act of 2007 as part of the 100-Hour Plan. The act raises the minimum wage in the United States and the territories of the Northern Marianas Islands and American Samoa. American Samoa was initially absent from the act, but it was included as part of HR 2206. One Republican congressman who voted against the initial bill accused Pelosi of unethically benefiting Del Monte Foods (headquartered in her district) by excluding the territory, where Del Monte's StarKist Tuna brand is a major employer.[215] Pelosi co-sponsored legislation that omitted American Samoa from a raise in the minimum wage as early as 1999, before Del Monte's acquisition of StarKist Tuna in 2002.[216]

Pelosi opposed the welfare reform President Bush proposed as well as reforms proposed and passed under President Clinton.[217] She also opposed the tax reform signed by Trump in December 2017, calling it ""probably one of the worst bills in the history of the United States of America ... It robs from the future [and] it rewards the rich ... and corporations at the expense of tens of millions of working middle-class families in our country.""[218] She said ""this is Armageddon"" and argued that the tax bill increased the debt in a way that would adversely impact social insurance spending.[219] In January 2018, shortly after the tax bill passed, a reporter asked Pelosi to respond to statements by companies crediting the tax cuts with allowing them to raise wages and give bonuses. She said that, given the benefits corporations received from the tax bill, the benefits workers got were ""crumbs"".[220][221] Most companies that awarded bonuses gave out payments of hundreds of dollars, while some gave bonuses significantly over $1,000.[222]

Infrastructure

In November 2018, Pelosi said she had spoken with Trump about infrastructure development. Though he ""really didn't come through with it in his first two years in office"" while it was a topic during his campaign, the subject had not been a partisan matter in Congress. She mentioned potential bipartisan legislative initiatives that would ""create good paying jobs and will also generate other economic growth in their regions"".[223] On May 1, 2019, Pelosi and Schumer met with Trump about infrastructure funding.[224] In late May, a meeting to discuss an impending $2 trillion infrastructure plan was cut short when Trump abruptly left after only a few minutes.[225]

Disaster relief

In August 2018, after Trump signed an emergency declaration for federal aid in combating the Carr Fire in Northern California, Pelosi called the move ""an important first step"" but requested that Trump accede to California Governor Jerry Brown's request for further aid to other hard-hit areas in California. She called on the Trump administration to take ""real, urgent action to combat the threat of the climate crisis, which is making the wildfire season longer, more expensive and more destructive"".[226]

Education

In 1999, Pelosi voted against displaying the Ten Commandments in public buildings, including schools.[227] She voted for the No Child Left Behind Act,[228] which instituted testing to track students' progress and authorized an increase in overall education spending.[229][230]

Environment

In 2019, Pelosi said climate change was ""the existential threat of our time"" and called for action to curb it.[231] She has supported the development of new technologies to reduce U.S. dependence on foreign oil and remediate the adverse environmental effects of burning fossil fuels.[232] Pelosi has widely supported conservation programs and energy research appropriations. She has also voted to remove an amendment that would allow for oil and gas exploration in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.[233][234]

Pelosi has blocked efforts to revive offshore oil drilling in protected areas, reasoning that offshore drilling could lead to an increase in dependence on fossil fuels.[235]

Health care

Affordable Care Act

Pelosi was instrumental in passing the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010.[236] She was a key figure in convincing Obama to continue pushing for health-care reform after the election of Massachusetts Senator Scott Brown in a January special election—a defeat seen as potentially fatal to Democratic reform efforts.[81] After delivering 219 votes in the House for Obama's health-care package, Pelosi was both praised and heckled as she made her way to Capitol Hill.[237][83]

Pelosi has voted to increase Medicare and Medicaid benefits.[238] She does not endorse Senator Bernie Sanders's bill for single-payer healthcare.[239][240]

On March 10, 2017, Pelosi said Democrats would continue battling Republican efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act, but would also be willing to form a compromise measure if Republicans reached out for support. She indicated her support for the Republican plan to expand Health Savings Accounts and said the question of Republicans' accepting an expansion of Medicaid was important.[241] In September, Pelosi sent a letter to Democrats praising Senator John McCain for announcing his opposition to the latest Republican effort to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act and called on lawmakers and advocacy groups alike to pressure Republicans in the health-care discussion. She said Democrats would be unified in putting ""a stake in the heart of this monstrous bill"".[242]

In July 2018, during a speech at Independence First, Pelosi said Democrats' goal ""has always been to expand coverage and to do so in a way that improves benefits ... and we have to address the affordability issue that is so undermined by the Republicans.""[243] In November 2018, after Democrats gained a majority in the House in the midterm elections, she said, ""I'm staying as Speaker to protect the Affordable Care Act. That's my main issue, because I think that's, again, about the health and financial health of the America's families, and if Hillary had won, I could go home."" She added that Republicans had misrepresented their earlier position of opposition to covering people with preexisting conditions during the election cycle and called on them to join Democrats in ""removing all doubt that the preexisting medical condition is the law—the benefit—is the law of the land"".[244]

Abortion

Pelosi voted against the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act of 2003 and earlier attempts at similar bans, and voted against the criminalization of certain situations where a minor is transported across state lines for an abortion (HR 748, passed).[245]

She has voted in favor of lifting the ban on privately funded abortions at overseas U.S. military facilities (HA 209, rejected); in favor of an amendment that would repeal a provision forbidding servicewomen and dependents from getting an abortion in overseas military hospitals (HA 722, rejected); and in favor of stripping the prohibition of funding for organizations working overseas that use their own funds to provide abortion services, or engage in advocacy related to abortion services (HA 997, rejected). She also voted in favor of the 1998 Abortion Funding Amendment, which would have allowed the use of district funds to promote abortion-related activities, but would have prohibited the use of federal funds.[245]

In 2008, she was rebuked by Archbishop Donald Wuerl of Washington, D.C., for being ""incorrect"" in comments she made to Tom Brokaw on Meet the Press concerning Church teaching on the subjects of abortion of when a human life begins. The archbishop's statement quoted Pelosi as saying the church has not been able to define when life begins. During the interview she said, ""over the history of the church, this [what constitutes the moment of conception] is an issue of controversy.""[246] In February 2009, Pelosi met with her bishop, Archbishop George Hugh Niederauer of San Francisco, and with Pope Benedict XVI regarding the controversy.

Pelosi opposed the 2022 overturning of Roe v. Wade, calling it ""cruel"", ""outrageous"" and ""heart-wrenching"".[247]

Contraception

In a January 25, 2009, interview with George Stephanopoulos for ABC News, Pelosi said that one of the reasons she supported family planning services was that they would ""reduce costs to states and to the federal government.""[248]

Security

Gun laws

Nancy Pelosi embracing Common at 2019 End Gun Violence, September 27, 2019

Pelosi stands in favor of increased background checks for potential gun owners, as well as the banning of assault weapons. In February 2013, she called for the ""Boldest possible move"" on gun control, similar to a stance made just weeks earlier by former Representative, mass shooting victim, and fellow gun control advocate Gabby Giffords.[249] In 2012, she was given a 0% rating by Gun Owners of America and a 7% rating from the National Rifle Association of America for her stances on gun control.[250]

In February 2018, following the Stoneman Douglas High School shooting, Pelosi said Republicans' ""cowering"" to the gun lobby was ""an assault on our whole country"" and that the victims were ""paying the price for our inaction"".[251] She requested House Speaker Ryan and Republicans take action via consideration of legislation expanding background checks or authorizing researchers to use federal dollars to examine public health as it relates to gun violence. Pelosi also advocated for the creation of a special committee on gun violence and said Republicans had previously created committees to investigate Planned Parenthood and the 2012 Benghazi attack.[251]

In November 2018, after the Thousand Oaks shooting, Pelosi released a statement saying Americans ""deserve real action to end the daily epidemic of gun violence that is stealing the lives of our children on campuses, in places of worship and on our streets"" and pledged that gun control would be a priority for House Democrats in the 116th United States Congress.[252]

Military draft

With regard to Representative Charles Rangel's (D-NY) plan to introduce legislation that would reinstate the draft, Pelosi said she did not support it.[253]

Use of government aircraft

In March 2009, conservative watchdog group Judicial Watch had obtained emails sent by Pelosi's staff requesting the United States Air Force (USAF) to provide specific aircraft—a Boeing 757—for Pelosi to use for taxpayer-funded travel.[254] Pelosi responded that the policy was initiated by President Bush due to post-9/11 security concerns (Pelosi was third in line for presidential succession), and was initially provided for the previous Speaker Dennis Hastert. The Sergeant at Arms requested—for security reasons—that the plane provided be capable of non-stop flight, requiring a larger aircraft. The Pentagon said ""no one has rendered judgment"" that Pelosi's use of aircraft ""is excessive"".[255]

First Trump presidency

President-elect Donald Trump with Pelosi in January 2017

During the first Trump administration, Pelosi voted in line with the president's stated position 17.6% of the time.[256]

During a news conference on June 9, 2017, after a reporter asked her about tweets by President Donald Trump lambasting former FBI director James Comey following Comey's testimony to the Senate Intelligence Committee, Pelosi said no one at the White House seemed courageous enough to tell Trump his tweets were beneath the dignity of the presidency and that she was worried about his fitness for office.[257] In November, when asked about Democrats beginning the impeachment process against Trump in the event they won a majority of seats in the 2018 elections, Pelosi said it would not be one of their legislative priorities but that the option could be considered if credible evidence appeared during the ongoing investigations into Russian interference in the 2016 election.[258]

In January 2018, Pelosi referred to Trump's 2018 State of the Union Address as a performance without serious policy ideas the parties could collaborate on. She questioned Trump's refusal to implement Russian sanctions after more than 500 members of Congress voted to approve them.[259] In February, after Trump blocked the release of a Democratic memo by the Intelligence Committee, Pelosi said the act was ""a stunningly brazen attempt to cover up the truth about the Trump-Russia scandal from the American people"" and ""part of a dangerous and desperate pattern of cover-up on the part of the president who has shown he had something to hide.""[260] In March, Pelosi said she was ""more concerned about the president's policies which undermine the financial security of America's working families"" than the Stormy Daniels–Donald Trump scandal. Pelosi did note the scandal as having highlighted a double standard of Republicans on issues of family values and expectations of presidential behavior, saying the party would be very involved if the event was happening to a Democrat.[261] In April, following Scooter Libby being pardoned by Trump, Pelosi released a statement saying the pardon ""sends a troubling signal to the president's allies that obstructing justice will be rewarded and that the idea of those who lie under oath being granted a pardon ""poses a threat to the integrity of the special counsel investigation, and to our democracy"".[262] On August 15, after Trump revoked the security clearance of former CIA director John Brennan, Pelosi said the move was ""a stunning abuse of power [and] a pathetic attempt to silence critics"", and an attempt by Trump to distract attention from other issues of his administration.[263] Pelosi and Charles E. Schumer met with Trump and Pence in December 2018 to discuss changes to be made when the new Democratic representatives takes office in 2019.[264] In January 2019 she supported President Trump in his decision to back the leader of the opposition Juan Guaidó during Venezuelan protests and constitutional crisis.[265]

Trump–Ukraine scandal and impeachment

The Democrats gained control of the House of Representatives in the November 2018 elections, and Pelosi took office as Speaker. Multiple House committees launched investigations into various actions by Trump and some of his cabinet members and requested or subpoenaed documents and information from the White House and the administration.[266] In April 2019, Trump vowed to defy ""all"" subpoenas from the House and to refuse to allow current or former administration officials to testify before House committees.[267]

Pelosi initially resisted efforts by some fellow House Democrats to pursue Trump's impeachment,[268][269] but in September 2019, following revelations of the Trump–Ukraine scandal, announced the beginning of a formal House impeachment inquiry, saying ""The actions taken to date by the president have seriously violated the Constitution"" and that Trump ""must be held accountable—no one is above the law.""[270] Privately, Pelosi expressed concern that focusing on impeachment would imperil the Democrats' House majority; she preferred to focus on other legislation.[271]

In May 2019, the White House intervened to halt former White House Counsel Don McGahn from complying with a subpoena issued by the House Judiciary Committee, instructing the committee to redirect its records requests to the White House. Pelosi, who had previously urged ""Democrats to focus on fact-finding rather than the prospect of any impeachment"",[272][273] described Trump's interference regarding McGahn's records as an obstruction of justice, saying that ""Trump is goading us to impeach him.""[274][275] Later that month, as the Trump administration continued to ignore subpoenas, refuse to release documents, and encourage or order current and former officials not to testify in Congress, Pelosi declared: ""we believe that the president of the United States is engaged in a cover-up.""[276] Later that day, after learning of Pelosi's comments, Trump walked away from a scheduled White House meeting with Pelosi and Schumer, in which a $2 trillion infrastructure plan was supposed to be discussed. Trump told Pelosi and Schumer he could not work with them until they stopped investigating him. Later in the day, Pelosi accused Trump of ""obstructing justice"" and again said he ""is engaged in a cover-up"".[277] On June 5, 2019, during a meeting with senior Democrats about whether the House should launch impeachment proceeding against Trump, Pelosi said, ""I don't want to see him impeached, I want to see him in prison."" According to multiple sources, rather than impeachment, she wanted to see Trump lose to a Democrat in the 2020 election, following which he could be prosecuted.[278] Eventually, under pressure from an alliance of left-wing Representatives led by Chair of the House Judiciary Committee Jerry Nadler, Pelosi backed an impeachment inquiry.[271]

The House impeachment inquiry focused on efforts by Trump and Trump administration officials to pressure the government of Ukraine to smear former Vice President Joe Biden, a political rival of Trump's, while withholding $400 million in U.S. military aid, and a White House visit, from Ukraine; the inquiry also examined Trump's request in a July 2019 phone call to Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky to ""do us a favor"" and investigate Biden.[279] On December 18, 2019, the House voted nearly along party lines to impeach Trump for abuse of power (230–197) and obstruction of Congress (229–198), making him the third president in U.S. history to be impeached. Pelosi said, when opening debate on the articles of impeachment, ""If we do not act now, we would be derelict in our duty. It is tragic that the president's reckless actions make impeachment necessary. He gave us no choice.""[279] Pelosi initially did not transmit the articles of impeachment to the Republican-controlled Senate for trial, seeking to negotiate an agreement with Senate Majority Mitch McConnell for the Senate to hear witness testimony and other additional evidence as part of a bid for a ""full and fair"" trial. McConnell rejected these efforts, and the House transmitted the articles to the Senate on January 15, 2020, with Pelosi naming seven Democratic Representatives, led by Representative Adam Schiff, as the House managers to argue the impeachment case against Trump in the Senate.[280][281] As expected, the Senate ultimately acquitted Trump in a nearly-party line vote in which every Democrat voted for conviction and all but one Republican, Senator Mitt Romney, voting for acquittal.[282] Ahead of the Senate vote Pelosi said that, irrespective of the outcome, the president ""has been impeached forever"", that the impeachment process had successfully ""pulled back a veil of behavior totally unacceptable to our founders, and that the public will see this with a clearer eye, an unblurred eye.""[283] Following the Senate vote, Pelosi criticized Trump and Senate Republicans, saying their actions had ""normalized lawlessness and rejected the system of checks and balances"".[284][285]

Following the Senate vote, Trump claimed vindication and criticized Democrats, the FBI, and Pelosi. In a speech at the National Prayer Breakfast, Trump referred to Pelosi as ""a horrible person"", and questioned her religious faith; Pelosi said these remarks were ""particularly without class"".[286] Before Trump's February 4, 2020 State of the Union Address, the day before the Senate impeachment vote, Trump and Pelosi exchanged mutual snubs.[287][288] Trump refused to shake Pelosi's outstretched hand, and Pelosi tore up her copy of Trump's speech.[287][288] Her stated reason for doing so was ""because it was a courteous thing to do considering the alternatives. It was a such a dirty speech.""[289] Pelosi also said Trump's speech ""had no contact with reality whatsoever""[290] and suggested the president appeared ""a little sedated"" during the address.[286] Pelosi's action was criticized by Trump and others.[291][292]

Days after the Senate impeachment vote, Trump fired two officials who had testified against him during the impeachment inquiry: U.S. Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland and Lieutenant Colonel Alexander Vindman, a National Security Council official. Pelosi called the firing of Vindman a ""shameful"" and ""clear and brazen act of retaliation that showcases the President's fear of the truth"", saying that ""History will remember Lieutenant Colonel Vindman as an American hero.""[293]

Commission to consider use of 25th Amendment

On October 8, 2020, Pelosi announced that legislation was being introduced in the House of Representatives to advance the creation of a commission to allow the use of the 25th Amendment to the Constitution to intervene and remove Trump from executive duties.[294]

Biden presidency

As of October 2022, Pelosi had voted in line with Joe Biden's stated position 100% of the time.[295]

Foreign affairs

China/Hong Kong/Taiwan

Pelosi with Chinese premier Wen Jiabao during a trip to China in 2009

Pelosi with Hong Kong activists who have become prominent figures in the 2019–2020 Hong Kong protests

After the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests, Pelosi sought to take a harsher position toward China than President George H.W. Bush.[296]: 210 With the support of Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, she took a lead role for the Democrats in criticizing Bush's China policy.[296]: 210 Pelosi's view was that Congress should oppose the annual presidential waiver for China under the Jackson-Vanik Amendment, an amendment to the Trade Act of 1974 that required the president to inform Congress if he intended to waive the Act to have a most favored nation trading relationship with a non-market economy.[296]: 211 Pelosi said that if China's economy suffered, Chinese people would be unhappy with their government and this would serve to advance democracy in China.[296]: 223

As part of a Congressional delegation, Pelosi unfurled a banner in the square in 1991, provoking a confrontation with Chinese police.[297] She advocated for Chinese political prisoners and dissidents to be able to come to the U.S.[297] In 1999, ahead of Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji's visit to the U.S. for talks over World Trade Organization admission for China, Pelosi called on President Clinton and Vice President Gore to ask Zhu to recognize the 1989 protests as a pro-democracy effort.[298]

In 2008, after a meeting with the Dalai Lama and officials in the Tibetan government-in-exile, Pelosi criticized the People's Republic of China for its handling of the unrest in Tibet; addressing a crowd of thousands of Tibetans in Dharamsala, India, Pelosi called on ""freedom-loving people"" worldwide to denounce China for its human rights abuses in Tibet.[299] The same year, Pelosi commended the European Parliament for its ""bold decision"" to award the Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought to Chinese dissident and human rights activist Hu Jia, and called upon the Chinese government ""to immediately and unconditionally release Hu Jia from prison and to respect the fundamental freedoms of all the people in China.""[300]

In 2010, Pelosi backed a bill naming China a currency manipulator, which would appease exporters.[301]

Pelosi criticized the imprisonment of Hong Kong democracy activists in August 2017 for their roles in a protest at the Civic Square in front of the Central Government Complex in Hong Kong. She called the ruling an injustice that should ""shock the conscience of the world"".[302]

Before the Trump administration took concrete measures against China in late March 2018, Pelosi and other Democratic leaders pressed Trump to focus more on China and impose real punishments, such as fulfilling his own campaign commitments to name China a currency manipulator and stop China from pressuring U.S. tech companies into giving up intellectual property rights. Pelosi urged Trump to take a strong stand against unfair market barriers in China.[303][304][305][306]

In September 2019, Pelosi met with Hong Kong pro-democracy activist Joshua Wong on Capitol Hill; Chinese media responded by accusing Pelosi of ""backing and encouraging radical activists"".[307]

On the eve of the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing, Pelosi advised American athletes competing: ""I would say to our athletes, 'You're there to compete. Do not risk incurring the anger of the Chinese government, because they are ruthless'"".[308]

On August 2, 2022, Pelosi became the highest-ranking U.S. government official to visit Taiwan in 25 years.[309][310][311] President Joe Biden discouraged but did not prevent Pelosi from traveling to Taiwan, and the White House later affirmed her right to visit.[312][313][314] Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell and 25 Senate Republicans backed Pelosi's decision to visit,[315] issuing a joint statement that also supported the trip.[316] Her trip triggered a new round of hostilities in the already tense relationship between the U.S. and China.[317] During and after her visit, China undertook a series of retaliatory measures against Taiwan and the United States. Pelosi said her visit was a sign of the U.S. Congress's commitment to Taiwan.[317] During her visit, she met with Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-Wen and called Taiwan one of the ""freest societies in the world"".[318] On August 5, 2022, the Chinese government sanctioned Pelosi for ""seriously interfering in China's internal affairs, undermining China's sovereignty and territorial integrity, trampling on the one-China policy, and threatening the peace and stability of the Taiwan Strait"".[319]

Colombia

Pelosi publicly scolded Colombian president Álvaro Uribe during Uribe's May 2007 state visit to America. Pelosi met with Uribe and later released a statement that she and other members of Congress had ""expressed growing concerns about the serious allegations"" of links between paramilitary groups and Colombian government officials.[320] Pelosi also came out against the Colombian free-trade agreement.[321]

Cuba

In 2008, Pelosi said: ""For years, I have opposed the embargo on Cuba. I don't think it's been successful, and I think we have to remove the travel bans and have more exchanges—people to people exchanges with Cuba.""[322] In 2015, Pelosi supported President Obama's Cuban Thaw, a rapprochement between the U.S. and Castro's regime in Cuba, and visited Havana for meetings with high-level officials.[323]

First Gulf War

Pelosi opposed U.S. intervention in the 1991 Gulf War.[217][324]

Iran

In an interview on February 15, 2007, Pelosi said that Bush consistently said he supports a diplomatic resolution to differences with Iran ""and I take him at his word"". At the same time, she said, ""I do believe that Congress should assert itself, though, and make it very clear that there is no previous authority for the president, any president, to go into Iran"".[325] On January 12, 2007, Congressman Walter B. Jones of North Carolina introduced a resolution[326] requiring that—absent a national emergency created by an attack, or a demonstrably imminent attack, by Iran upon the United States or its armed forces—the president must consult with Congress and receive specific authorization prior to initiating any use of military force against Iran.[327] This resolution was removed from a military spending bill for the war in Iraq by Pelosi on March 13, 2007.

In July 2015, Pelosi said she was convinced Obama would have enough votes to secure the Iran nuclear deal, crediting the president with having made a ""very strong and forceful presentation of his case supporting the nuclear agreement with Iran"" and called the deal ""a diplomatic masterpiece"".[328]

In 2016, Pelosi argued against two bills that if enacted would block Iran's access to the dollar and impose sanctions for its ballistic missile program: ""Regardless of whether you supported the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), we all agree that Iran must not possess a nuclear weapon. At this time, the JCPOA is the best way to achieve this critical goal.""[329]

In May 2018, after Trump announced his intention to withdraw from the Iran nuclear deal, Pelosi said the decision was an abdication of American leadership and ""particularly senseless, disturbing & dangerous"".[330]

Iraq War

In 2002, Pelosi opposed the Iraq Resolution authorizing President George W. Bush to use military force against Iraq, which passed the House on a 296–133 vote.[31][32] Pelosi said that ""unilateral use of force without first exhausting every diplomatic remedy and other remedies and making a case to the American people will be harmful to our war on terrorism.""[33] In explaining her opposition to the resolution, Pelosi said CIA Director George Tenet had told Congress the likelihood of Saddam Hussein's launching an attack on the U.S. using weapons of mass destruction was low, saying: ""This is about the Constitution It is about this Congress asserting its right to declare war when we are fully aware what the challenges are to us. It is about respecting the United Nations and a multilateral approach, which is safer for our troops.""[32]

Although Pelosi voted against the Iraq War, anti-war activists in San Francisco protested against her voting to continue funding the war. UC Berkeley political scientist Bruce Cain said Pelosi had to balance the demands of her anti-war constituency against the moderate views of Democrats in tight races around the country in her role as minority leader.[331] Pelosi has never faced a serious challenger to her left in her district.[332]

Israel

Pelosi at AIPAC's annual Policy Conference in Washington, D.C.

Pelosi has reaffirmed that ""America and Israel share an unbreakable bond: in peace and war; and in prosperity and in hardship"".[333] She has emphasized that ""a strong relationship between the United States and Israel has long been supported by both Democrats and Republicans. America's commitment to the safety and security of the State of Israel is unwavering ... [h]owever, the war in Iraq has made both America and Israel less safe."" Pelosi's voting record shows consistent support for Israel. Pelosi voted in favor of the Jerusalem Embassy Act of 1995, which urged the federal government to relocate the American embassy in Israel to Jerusalem.[334] Before the 2006 elections in the Palestinian Authority, she voted for a Congressional initiative that disapproved of participation in the elections by Hamas and other organizations the legislation defined as terrorist. She agrees with the current U.S. stance in support of land-for-peace. She has applauded Israeli ""hopeful signs"" of offering land while criticizing Palestinian ""threats"" of not demonstrating peace in turn. Pelosi has said, ""If the Palestinians agree to coordinate with Israel on the evacuation, establish the rule of law, and demonstrate a capacity to govern, the world may be convinced that finally there is a real partner for peace"".[333]

During the 2006 Lebanon War, Pelosi voted in favor of Resolution 921: ""... seizure of Israeli soldiers by Hezbollah terrorists was an unprovoked attack and Israel has the right, and indeed the obligation, to respond."" She argues that organizations and political bodies in the Mideast like Hamas and Hezbollah ""have a greater interest in maintaining a state of hostility with Israel than in improving the lives of the people they claim to represent"". Pelosi asserts that civilians on both sides of the border ""have been put at risk by the aggression of Hamas and Hezbollah"" in part for their use of ""civilians as shields by concealing weapons in civilian areas"".[335]

In September 2008, Pelosi hosted a reception in Washington with Israeli Speaker of the Knesset Dalia Itzik, along with 20 members of Congress, where they toasted the ""strong friendship"" between Israel and the United States. During the ceremony, Pelosi held up replica dog tags of the three Israeli soldiers captured by Hezbollah and Hamas in 2006 and said she keeps them as a ""symbol of the sacrifices made, sacrifices far too great by the people of the state of Israel"".[336]

Pelosi and Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Jerusalem, January 2020

Pelosi supported Israel in the 2014 Israel–Gaza conflict.[337] In March 2018 Pelosi said, ""There is no greater political accomplishment in the 20th Century than the establishment of the State of Israel.""[338] Pelosi condemned Rep. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota for posting controversial tweets related to Jews and Israel.[339] In March 2019, she said, ""Israel and America are connected now and forever. We will never allow anyone to make Israel a wedge issue.""[340]

In January 2017, Pelosi voted against a House resolution that would condemn the UN Security Council Resolution 2334. This UN Security Council Resolution called Israeli settlement building in the occupied Palestinian territories in the West Bank a ""flagrant violation"" of international law and a major obstacle to peace.[341][342] She condemned the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions (BDS) movement targeting Israel.[343]

Pelosi has voiced heavy criticism over Israel's plan to annex parts of the West Bank and the Jordan Valley. She said Israeli annexation would undermine U.S. national security interests.[344] Pelosi said that Democrats are taking ""a great pride"" in Barack Obama's Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) that Israel signed with the Obama administration in 2016, for a guarantee of $38 billion in defense assistance over a decade.[344]

On January 28, 2024, Pelosi suggested that some pro-Palestinian protesters calling for a ceasefire in the Israel–Hamas war could be connected to Russia and called on the FBI to investigate the possible connection.[345]

North Korea

Nancy Pelosi is one of the few members of Congress to have traveled to North Korea. She has expressed concern about the danger of nuclear proliferation from the North Korean regime, and the ongoing problems of hunger and oppression imposed by that country's leadership.[346][347]

In August 2017, following Trump's warning that North Korea ""will be met with fire and fury like the world has never seen"" in the event of further threats to the United States, Pelosi said the comments were ""recklessly belligerent and demonstrate a grave lack of appreciation for the severity of the North Korean nuclear situation. His saber-rattling and provocative, impulsive rhetoric erode our credibility.""[348]

In November 2017, after the Pentagon sent a letter to lawmakers stating a ground invasion was the only way to destroy all North Korea's nuclear weapons without concern for having missed any, Pelosi said she was concerned about Pyongyang's selling nuclear technology to third parties and called for the United States to ""exhaust every other remedy"".[349]

In June 2018, after Trump praised North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, Pelosi said in a statement, ""In his haste to reach an agreement, President Trump elevated North Korea to the level of the United States while preserving the regime's status quo.""[350]

Russia

Pelosi meeting with Russian president Dmitry Medvedev, foreign minister Sergey Lavrov, and ambassador Sergey Kislyak, June 2010

In December 2017, Pelosi wrote a letter to Speaker Paul Ryan advocating for the continued House investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election on the grounds that Americans deserved ""a comprehensive and fair investigation into Russia's attack"" and ""America's democracy and national security"" being at stake. Pelosi cited the need for Congress to ""fully investigate Russia's assault on our election systems to prevent future foreign attacks"".[351]

In February 2018, after the release of a Republican report alleging surveillance abuses by the Justice Department, Pelosi accused Trump of siding with Russian president Vladimir Putin at the expense of preserving intelligence sources and methods.[352] In July, Pelosi asserted that Trump was afraid to mention the 12 indictments against people connected to the intelligence community in Russia during his meeting with Putin and questioned what intelligence the Russians had on Trump to cause his behavior.[353] She said Putin would not be welcomed by Congress even if he visited Washington as a result of his actions: ""Putin's ongoing attacks on our elections and on Western democracies and his illegal actions in Crimea and the rest of Ukraine deserve the fierce, unanimous condemnation of the international community, not a VIP ticket to our nation's capital."" She called for House Speaker Ryan to ""make clear that there is not—and never will be—an invitation for a thug like Putin to address the United States Congress.""[354]

On multiple occasions, Pelosi said of Trump, ""With him, all roads lead to Putin,"" including with regard to the Trump-Ukraine scandal,[355] a lack of action against the alleged Russian bounty program,[356] and Trump's incitement of the January 6 United States Capitol attack.[357]

Syria, Libya, and Afghanistan

Pelosi supports the Syria Accountability Act and Iran Freedom and Support Act. In a speech at the AIPAC 2005 annual conference, Pelosi said that ""for too long, leaders from both parties haven't done enough"" to put pressure on Russia and China who are providing Iran with technological information on nuclear issues and missiles. ""If evidence of participation by other nations in Iran's nuclear program is discovered, I will insist that the Administration use, rather than ignore, the evidence in determining how the U.S. deals with that nation or nations on other issues.""[358] In April 2007, Pelosi visited Syria, where she met Foreign Minister Walid Muallem, Vice President Farouk al-Sharaa and President Bashar al-Assad, despite President Bush efforts to isolate Syria, because of militants crossing from Syria into Iraq, and supporting Hezbollah and Hamas.[359] During her visit, she conveyed Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert message for peace, and toured in Al-Hamidiyah Souq,[360] and the Umayyad Mosque.[361]

Pelosi supported the NATO-led military intervention in Libya in 2011.[362] She also favored arming Syria's rebel fighters.[363]

In January 2019, Pelosi criticized President Trump's planned withdrawal of U.S. troops from Syria and Afghanistan. She called Trump's announcement a ""Christmas gift to Vladimir Putin"".[364] In an October 2019 letter to Democratic caucus members, Pelosi wrote that both parties were condemning President Trump's deserting the US's ""Kurdish allies in a foolish attempt to appease an authoritarian strongman"" Recep Tayyip Erdoğan of Turkey and opined that the decision ""poses a dire threat to regional security and stability, and sends a dangerous message to Iran and Russia, as well as our allies, that the United States is no longer a trusted partner"".[365] Later that month, she visited Jordan to discuss the Syrian situation with King Abdullah II.[366] Afterwards, she went to Afghanistan, where she met President Ashraf Ghani and chief executive officer Abdullah Abdullah, and she was also briefed by U.S. diplomats on reconciliation efforts with the Taliban.[367]

Turkey

In mid-October 2007, after the House Foreign Affairs Committee passed a resolution to label the 1915 killing of Armenians by Ottoman Turks as genocide, Pelosi pledged to bring the measure to a vote.[368] The draft resolution prompted warnings from President Bush and fierce criticism from Turkey, with Turkey's Prime Minister saying that approval of the resolution would endanger U.S.–Turkey relations.[369] After House support eroded, the measure's sponsors dropped their call for a vote, and in late October Pelosi agreed to set the matter aside.[370]

The resolution was passed during Pelosi's second term as Speaker. The House voted 405 to 11 in October 2019 to confirm the resolution.[371]

Ukraine

On April 30, 2022, Pelosi met with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in Kyiv, to pledge U.S. support for Ukraine during the Russian invasion.[372][373]

Gaza

After the drone strikes on aid workers from World Central Kitchen in April 2024, Pelosi, Mark Pocan, James P. McGovern, Jan Schakowsky, and 36 other Congressional Democrats urged President Biden in an open letter to reconsider planned arms shipments to the Israeli military.[374][375]

Public image

Pelosi has often been described as a polarizing figure, facing criticism from both the political right and left. Progressives have criticized her for her knowledge of waterboarding and other enhanced interrogation techniques during the War on Terror, accusing her of not objecting strongly enough to these practices.[376] Conservatives and libertarians have taken issue with her positions on gun rights, viewing her advocacy for gun control as an infringement on Second Amendment rights.[377] They have also criticized her stance on taxation, particularly her support for higher taxes on the wealthy and corporations to fund social programs.[376] Pelosi's role in leading the House to impeach President Donald Trump twice has drawn significant criticism from Trump supporters and Republicans, who perceived the impeachments as politically motivated and divisive.[376][378]

Pelosi has faced allegations of using her position for insider trading, particularly concerning stock transactions that critics claim were influenced by her legislative knowledge.[379] Critics have also depicted her as a symbol of liberal elitism, pointing to her strong opposition to populism and comments suggesting that some Americans reject Democratic policies due to their beliefs about ""guns, gays, [and] God"".[376][380] During the COVID-19 pandemic, Pelosi was accused of hypocrisy when she had her hair styled at a salon that was supposed to be closed for indoor appointments due to health restrictions, with critics alleging she used her position to receive preferential treatment.[381]

Electoral history

The city of San Francisco named a street in Golden Gate Park in honor of Pelosi after her many years representing the city in Congress.

Pelosi's only close race so far has been in the special election to succeed U.S. Representative Sala Burton after her death in February 1987. Pelosi defeated San Francisco Supervisor Harry Britt in the Democratic primary with 36 percent of the vote to his 32 percent,[15][382] then Republican Harriet Ross by more than 2-to-1.[383] Since then, Pelosi has enjoyed overwhelming support in her political career, collecting 76 and 77 percent of the vote in California's 5th congressional district 1988 and 1990. In 1992, after the redistricting from the 1990 census, Pelosi ran in California's 8th congressional district, which now covered the San Francisco area. She has continued to post landslide victories since, dropping beneath 80 percent of the vote only three times in general elections. After redistricting from the 2010 census, Pelosi ran in California's 12th congressional district, which she represented for the next decade. Due to the 2020 United States redistricting cycle from the 2020 census, Pelosi now represents California's 11th congressional district, which covers San Francisco.[384]

Personal life

Pelosi at the LBJ Presidential Library in 2022

Nancy D'Alesandro met Paul Francis Pelosi while she was attending college.[385] They married in Baltimore at the Cathedral of Mary Our Queen on September 7, 1963.[386] They then moved to New York, followed by a move to San Francisco in 1969, where her husband's brother Ronald Pelosi was a member of the City and County of San Francisco's Board of Supervisors.[387]

Nancy and Paul Pelosi have five children, including Christine and Alexandra, and nine grandchildren.[388] Alexandra, a journalist, covered the Republican presidential campaigns in 2000 and made a film about the experience, Journeys with George. In 2007, Christine published a book, Campaign Boot Camp: Basic Training for Future Leaders.[389]

Pelosi resides in the Pacific Heights neighborhood of San Francisco.[390][391] Her 2016 financial disclosure report lists among her assets a combined home and vineyard in St. Helena, California, two commercial buildings in San Francisco, and a townhouse in Loomis, California.[392] In January 2021, her San Francisco home was vandalized with graffiti, messages of ""[c]ancel rent"" were left on her garage, along with fake blood and a severed pig's head.[393][394]

Financial status

Pelosi's husband, Paul, is a wealthy investor and the primary source of the couple's wealth.[395] In 2009, OpenSecrets estimated Pelosi's net worth at $58 million, making her the 13th-wealthiest member of Congress.[396] In 2014, OpenSecrets reported Pelosi's net worth had almost doubled, to about $101 million, making her the 8th-wealthiest.[397] Business Insider reported that Pelosi's net worth was $26.4 million in 2012 and made her the 13th-richest member of Congress.[398] In 2018, Roll Call estimated Pelosi's net worth at $16.0 million, making her the 30th-wealthiest member.[399]

Roll Call said Pelosi's earnings are connected to her husband's heavy investments in stocks that include Apple, Disney, Comcast and Facebook. Roll Call reported that the couple have $13.46 million in liabilities including mortgages on seven properties. According to Roll Call, Pelosi and her husband hold properties ""worth at least $23 million, including a St. Helena vineyard in Napa Valley worth at least $5 million.""[399]

As of 2021, Pelosi's net worth was valued at $120 million, making her the 6th richest person in Congress. According to journalist Glenn Greenwald, the Pelosis have traded $33 million worth of tech stocks over the past two years, including Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, Facebook, and Google stocks.[400] In May and June 2021, Pelosi's husband purchased stocks in tech companies such as Alphabet, Amazon, and Apple, netting a gain of $5.3 million. This occurred even while Speaker Pelosi was working on anti-trust legislation to better regulate the tech industry.[401] The CEO of Apple, Tim Cook, had called Pelosi to lobby her in opposition to the new regulations.[402] Pelosi opposes increasing regulations on stock trades by members of congress, stating that ""we're a free market economy"" and congresspeople ""should be able to participate in that.""[403] This comment drew strong criticism, including from Democrats who favor banning stock trades by members of Congress.[404]

Involvement in Italian-American community

Pelosi is a board member of the National Organization of Italian American Women.[405] She served for 13 years as a board member of the National Italian American Foundation (NIAF). In 2007, she received the NIAF Special Achievement Award for Public Advocacy and remains involved in the foundation.

Catholic church

Pelosi considers herself a ""devout Catholic"", but has had numerous disagreements with members of the church hierarchy over gay rights, abortion, contraception, and in vitro fertilization. She has said that her biggest disappointment was the church's lobbying against the Affordable Care Act because of contraception coverage.[22]

Pelosi and Catholic bishops have also disagreed about abortion rights. Although she thought it was ""lovely"" that she had five children in a little over six years, she argued that ""It's a woman's right to make her own choices with her family, her God, her doctor.""[22]

On May 20, 2022, Salvatore Cordileone, archbishop of San Francisco, announced that Pelosi would be barred from receiving Holy Communion because of her support of pro-choice abortion policies.[406] Cordileone had communicated his concerns on April 7, 2022, writing, ""should you not publicly repudiate your advocacy for abortion 'rights' or else refrain from referring to your Catholic faith in public and receiving Holy Communion, I would have no choice but to make a declaration, in keeping with Canon 915, that you are not to be admitted to Holy Communion.""[407]

On June 29, 2022, Pelosi received Communion at a Papal Mass presided over by Pope Francis in Rome at St. Peter's Basilica.[408][409]

Nancy Pelosi served as the 52nd Speaker of the House of Representatives, having made history in 2007 when she was elected the first woman to serve as Speaker of the House. She made history again in January 2019 when she regained her position second-in-line to the presidency – the first person to do so in more than six decades.

Pelosi is the chief architect of generation-defining legislation under two Democratic administrations, including the Affordable Care Act and the American Rescue Plan. She led House Democrats for 20 years and previously served as House Democratic Whip. In 2013, she was inducted into the National Women’s Hall of Fame at a ceremony in Seneca Falls, the birthplace of the American women’s rights movement. In 2024, she was awarded by President Biden the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation’s highest civilian honor.

Pelosi has represented San Francisco in Congress for 37 years. Currently serving as Speaker Emerita of the House and as the Representative for California’s 11th Congressional District, she is fighting For The People to lower costs, grow paychecks and create jobs.

Under the Biden-Harris Administration, Speaker Pelosi led the House in crafting and enacting the American Rescue Plan. This life-saving legislation turned the tide of the pandemic: getting vaccines into hundreds of millions of Americans’ arms, delivering direct assistance to families in need, creating millions of new jobs, supporting teachers, police officers, firefighters, transit workers and other frontline heroes, and returning children safely to schools. Speaker Pelosi also engineered House passage of the bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, which is strengthening roads, bridges, ports, water systems and broadband access in communities across the country while rebuilding America’s middle class. Her leadership on the House-passed Build Back Better Act paved the way for the enactment of the Inflation Reduction Act: historic action to bring down the cost of prescription drugs, lower health care premiums, deliver the most consequential climate action in human history and pay down the federal deficit. Pelosi was a key negotiator in assembling the bipartisan and bicameral CHIPS and Science Act, which is powering America to world leader status in semiconductor production and scientific discovery, while building a diverse and inclusive STEM workforce in communities across the country.

In the 111th Congress, Speaker Pelosi led the House passage of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act to rescue the nation from the depths of the financial crisis, helping create or save millions of American jobs. Her leadership in enshrining the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act into law helped restore the ability of women to fight pay discrimination in the courts and ensure they too could participate in the economic recovery. Pelosi also led the Congress in enacting the historic Dodd-Frank reforms to rein in big banks and create strong protections for consumers, seniors and Servicemembers.

Speaker Pelosi has long been a champion for families’ health care. Pelosi was the architect of the landmark Affordable Care Act, which has guaranteed protections for all Americans with pre-existing medical conditions, forbid insurers from treating being a woman as a pre-existing condition, ended annual and lifetime limits on health coverage, and provided affordable health coverage for tens of millions more Americans. As Democratic Leader in 2017, Pelosi led the charge to defend American families from Republicans’ monstrous “Trumpcare” legislation: mobilizing a massive nationwide campaign in support of the ACA and powering Democrats back into the Majority in 2018. For decades, Pelosi has also been a relentless leader on reducing the costs of prescription drugs by empowering the federal government to negotiate drug prices and capping out-of-pocket costs for seniors: action enshrined into law in the Inflation Reduction Act.

Pelosi has made the climate crisis the flagship issue of her Speakership. In 2022, Speaker Pelosi delivered House passage of the Inflation Reduction Act – which contained the biggest, boldest climate action in history. This law included many House-crafted provisions to accelerate America’s transition to a clean energy future: putting the nation on a path to slash carbon pollution by 40 percent by 2030, while creating millions of new jobs and advancing environmental justice. This builds on progress from Pelosi’s first Speakership: in 2007, she enacted comprehensive energy legislation that raised vehicle fuel efficiency standards for the first time in three decades and made a game-changing commitment to America’s homegrown biofuels. In 2009, she led passage of the American Clean Energy and Security Act to create clean energy jobs, combat the climate crisis and transition America to a clean energy economy.

A leader on conservation and the environment at home and abroad, Pelosi authored legislation to create the Presidio Trust and transform San Francisco’s former military post into an urban national park. She also secured passage of the “Pelosi Amendment” in 1989, now a global tool used to assess the potential environmental impacts of development.

Speaker Pelosi has been a force for accountability, transparency and participation in government. Under her leadership, the House enacted the toughest ethics reform legislation in the history of the Congress – including the creation of an independent ethics panel. Pelosi also led an historic legislative campaign for voting rights, passing two once-in-a-generation pieces of legislation. The For The People Act would expand access to the ballot, clean up corruption in government, outlaw partisan gerrymandering and combat dark money in politics, and the John R. Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act would restore the federal government’s power to defend access to the ballot across the country.

Speaker Pelosi is a steadfast defender of the Constitution and the rule of law. In 2019, after President Trump violated his oath of office by soliciting foreign intervention in the upcoming presidential election and withholding Congressionally appropriated assistance to Ukraine, the Democratic House launched an investigation that resulted in the third presidential impeachment in history. In 2021, after President Trump incited a violent insurrection targeting the U.S. Capitol and sought to overturn the results of the election, the House impeached Trump a second time. Speaker Pelosi then led the House in creating the bipartisan Select Committee to Investigate the January 6th Attack on the United States Capitol.

Pelosi has been a staunch champion of America’s national security and a respected voice abroad in promoting democratic values. She is the longest-serving Member of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence in history: serving from 1993-2003, including as Ranking Member from 2000-2003, and continues to serve in an ex officio capacity. As Speaker, she marshaled billions of dollars in security, economic and humanitarian assistance for the people of Ukraine after Russia’s unlawful invasion in February 2022. She orchestrated an overwhelmingly bipartisan and bicameral effort to impose swift and severe consequences on Russia, including a ban on the import of Russian energy and the revocation of normal trade relations.

For decades, Pelosi has offered a powerful voice for human rights around the world – especially speaking out on behalf of Uyghur communities, the citizens of Hong Kong, the Tibetan people and all those oppressed by the government of China. In 2022, she became the first House Speaker and highest-ranking U.S. official to travel to Taiwan in a quarter-century: an historic visit that reaffirmed America’s unwavering support for the people of Taiwan. As Democratic Leader, she helped strengthen America’s security by securing the votes needed to defeat Republicans’ effort to disapprove of President Obama’s Iran Nuclear Agreement, a landmark policy that halted Iran’s progress toward a nuclear weapon.

Speaker Pelosi has long been a leader in the fight for full equality. She spearheaded the historic repeal of the discriminatory “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell” policy, allowing gay and lesbian Americans to openly serve their country. She passed the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd, Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act, a law advancing justice for the millions of Americans at risk of violence for being who they are. As Speaker, she twice passed the watershed Equality Act: ensuring justice for the LGBTQ community in the workplace and in every place. Pelosi also led the charge to fight back against the Trump Administration’s hateful ban on transgender Servicemembers.

While serving as Democratic Leader, Pelosi’s strength at the negotiating table wrested critical legislative victories out of the GOP majority. In the 114th Congress, she achieved an historic bipartisan agreement to strengthen Medicare: ending the cycle of expensive “Doc Fix” patches and building a system that improves accuracy of payments and quality of care. She also delivered significant funding increases for key Democratic priorities, including the fight against the opioid epidemic, support for NIH medical research and permanent authorization of the World Trade Center Health Program.

Negotiating directly with the Trump Administration, Speaker Pelosi was crucial to securing vital relief for families and small businesses in early COVID-19 pandemic relief laws. Additional key accomplishments signed into law during her four terms as Speaker include: landmark gun violence prevention measures; legislation to expand educational opportunities while reforming the financial aid system; legislation to provide health care for eleven million American children; new protections against hate crimes; an increase in the minimum wage for the first time in a decade; the largest college aid expansion since the GI bill; new funding to address PFAS forever chemicals; a new GI education bill for veterans of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars; and increased services for veterans, caregivers and the Veterans Administration. With Speaker Pelosi at the helm, the House also advanced important legislation to ensure equal pay for equal work; save lives through a reinstatement of the Assault Weapons Ban and mandatory background checks for gun purchases; protect pregnant workers against discrimination; reform America’s broken immigration system and secure justice for Dreamers and farmworkers; care for veterans exposed to toxic chemicals in the line of duty; and protect borrowers from unfair lending practices.

Pelosi comes from a strong family tradition of public service. Her late father, Thomas D’Alesandro Jr., served as Mayor of Baltimore for twelve years, after representing the city for five terms in Congress. Her brother, Thomas D’Alesandro III, also served as Mayor of Baltimore. She graduated from Trinity College in Washington, D.C. She and her husband, Paul Pelosi, a native of San Francisco, have five grown children and ten grandchildren."
Nancy Pelosi,United States,en,https://www.speaker.gov/,"Because all men are created equal and in the image of God, every human life has inestimable dignity and value, and every person should be measured only by the content of their character. A just government protects life, honors marriage and family as the primary institutions of a healthy society, and embraces the vital cultural influences of religion and morality. Public policy should always encourage education and emphasize the virtue of hard work as a pathway out of-poverty, while public assistance programs should be reserved only for those who are truly in need. In America, everyone who plays by the rules should get a fair shot. By preserving these ideals, we will maintain the goodness of America that has been the secret to our greatness."
Mitch McConnell,United States,en,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitch_McConnell,"American politician and lawyer (born 1942)

Addison Mitchell McConnell III[1] ( ; born February 20, 1942) is an American politician and retired attorney serving as the senior United States senator from Kentucky, a seat he has held since 1985. McConnell is in his seventh Senate term and is the longest-serving senator in Kentucky history. He served from 2007 to 2025 as the leader of the Senate Republican Conference, including two stints as minority leader (2007 to 2015 and 2021 to 2025), and was majority leader from 2015 to 2021, making him the longest-serving Senate party leader in U.S. history.

McConnell holds conservative political positions, although he was known as a pragmatist and a moderate Republican early in his political career. He led opposition to stricter campaign finance laws, culminating in the U.S. Supreme Court decision Citizens United v. FEC, which partially overturned the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act (McCain-Feingold) in 2010. McConnell worked to withhold Republican support for major presidential initiatives during the Obama administration, making frequent use of the filibuster, and blocked many of President Obama's judicial nominees, including Supreme Court nominee Merrick Garland.

During the first Trump administration, the Senate Republican majority under McConnell's leadership passed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act in 2018, the First Step Act, and the Great American Outdoors Act, and confirmed a record number of federal appeals court judges during a president's first two years. McConnell invoked the nuclear option to eliminate the 60-vote requirement to end a filibuster for Supreme Court nominations, after his predecessor Harry Reid had eliminated the filibuster for all other presidential nominations; Trump subsequently won Supreme Court confirmation battles over Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett. While supportive of most of Trump's domestic and foreign policies, McConnell criticized Trump's attempts to overturn the 2020 presidential election, and despite voting to acquit in Trump's second impeachment trial for reasons related to the constitutionality of impeaching a former president, deemed him ""practically and morally responsible"" for the January 6 United States Capitol attack.[2] In late 2024, McConnell wrote an essay on his current view of American power and the foreign policy mistakes of former presidents.[3]

In 2015, 2019 and 2023, Time listed McConnell as one of the 100 most influential people in the world.[4][5] On February 28, 2024, McConnell announced that he would step down as the Senate Republican Conference Leader in January 2025, but would serve the remainder of his Senate term.[6][7][8] An internal election to fill the post of Senate Republican Leader was held on November 13, in which South Dakota senator John Thune was selected.[9]

On February 20, 2025 (his 83rd birthday), McConnell announced he would not run for an eighth Senate term in 2026 and would retire from politics. This came after increasing concerns about his health and ability to continue serving.[10][11]

Early life and education (1942–1967)

McConnell was born on February 20, 1942, to Julia Odene ""Dean"" (née Shockley) and Addison Mitchell ""A.M."" McConnell II[12] at Colbert County Hospital in Sheffield, Alabama, and grew up in Athens, Alabama, where his grandfather, Robert Hayes McConnell Sr., and his great-uncle, Addison Mitchell McConnell, owned McConnell Funeral Home.[12][13] He is of Scots-Irish and English descent. His ancestor James McConnell fought on the American side in the American Revolutionary War.[12][14]

In 1944, at the age of two, McConnell's upper left leg was paralyzed by a polio attack.[12][15] He and his mother were living with an aunt in Five Points, Alabama, at the time, and he received treatment at the Roosevelt Warm Springs Institute for Rehabilitation.[16] The treatment potentially saved him from being disabled for the rest of his life.[17] McConnell said his family ""almost went broke"" because of costs related to his illness.[18]

In 1950, when he was eight, McConnell moved with his family from Athens to Augusta, Georgia, where his father, who was in the Army, was stationed at Fort Gordon.[19]

In 1956, his family moved to Louisville, Kentucky, where he attended duPont Manual High School.[19] McConnell was elected student council president at his high school during his junior year.[19] He graduated Omicron Delta Kappa from the University of Louisville with a B.A. in political science in 1964 with honors.[20] He was president of the Student Council of the College of Arts and Sciences and a member of the Phi Kappa Tau fraternity.[21]

McConnell attended the 1963 March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom, where Martin Luther King Jr. gave the ""I Have a Dream"" speech.[22] In 1964, at the age of 22, he attended civil rights rallies,[23] and interned with Senator John Sherman Cooper. He has said his time with Cooper inspired him to run for the Senate later in life.[24][25]

In 1967, McConnell graduated from the University of Kentucky College of Law, where he was president of the Student Bar Association.[21][26]

Early career (1967–1984)

In March 1967, shortly before the expiration of his educational draft deferment upon graduation from law school, McConnell enlisted in the U.S. Army Reserve as a private at Louisville.[27] This was a coveted position because the Reserve units were mostly kept out of combat during the Vietnam War.[27][28]: 11–12 His first day of training at Fort Knox, Kentucky, was July 9, 1967, two days after taking the bar exam, and his last day was August 15, 1967.[21][27] Shortly after his arrival he was diagnosed with optic neuritis and deemed medically unfit for military service, and was honorably discharged.[27][29] McConnell's political opponents have repeatedly made an issue of his brief time in service during his electoral campaigns.[27][29][30]

From 1968 to 1970, McConnell worked as chief legislative assistant to Senator Marlow Cook in Washington, D.C., managing a legislative department consisting of five members as well as assisting with speechwriting and constituent services.[31]

In 1971, McConnell returned to Louisville, where he worked on Tom Emberton's campaign for governor of Kentucky, which was unsuccessful.[31] McConnell attempted to run for a seat in the state legislature but was disqualified because he did not meet the residency requirements for the office.[31] He then worked for the Louisville law firm Segal, Isenberg, Sales and Stewart for a few years.[32][31] During the same period, he taught a night class on political science at the University of Louisville.[26][33][34]

In October 1974, McConnell returned to Washington to fill a position as Deputy Assistant Attorney General under President Ford, where he worked alongside Robert Bork, Laurence Silberman, and Antonin Scalia.[26][31] He also served as acting United States Assistant Attorney General for the Office of Legislative Affairs under President Ford in 1975.[35][36]

In 1977, McConnell was elected the Jefferson County judge/executive, the top political office in Jefferson County, Kentucky, at the time, defeating incumbent Democrat Todd Hollenbach III, 53% to 47%. He was reelected in 1981 against Jefferson County Commissioner Jim ""Pop"" Malone, 51% to 47%, outspending Malone 3–1, and occupied the office until his election to the U.S. Senate in 1984.[24][31]

In his early years as a politician in Kentucky, McConnell was known as a pragmatist and a moderate Republican.[24][28] Over time he became more conservative.[24][28] According to one of his biographers, McConnell transformed ""from a moderate Republican who supported abortion rights and public employee unions to the embodiment of partisan obstructionism and conservative orthodoxy on Capitol Hill.""[28] McConnell has widely been described as an obstructionist.[37]

From 1997 to 2001, McConnell chaired the National Republican Senatorial Committee, the body charged with securing electoral victories for Republicans.[38][39] On February 12, 1999, he was one of 50 senators to vote to convict and remove Bill Clinton from office.[40] He was first elected Majority Whip in the 108th Congress.[41] Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist did not seek reelection in the 2006 elections. In November, after Republicans lost control of the Senate, they elected McConnell minority leader.[42] After Republicans took control of the Senate following the 2014 Senate elections, McConnell became the Senate Majority Leader.[43] In June 2018 he became the longest-serving Senate Republican leader in U.S. history.[44] McConnell is the second Kentuckian to serve as a party leader in the Senate (after Alben W. Barkley led the Democrats from 1937 to 1949)[20] and the longest-serving U.S. senator from Kentucky.[45]

McConnell has a reputation as a skilled political strategist and tactician.[46][47][48][49] This reputation dimmed after Republicans failed to repeal the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) in 2017 during consolidated Republican control of government.[50][51][52][53]

McConnell regularly obtained earmarks for businesses and institutions in Kentucky until Congress banned the practice in 2010.[54] He has been criticized for funding ""temporary patches"" to Kentucky's long-term healthcare problems while simultaneously opposing and obstructing national programs that seek to improve healthcare more systematically, such as Obamacare and Medicaid expansion.[34]

Relationships with presidential administrations

Obama

As the leading Republican senator, McConnell confronted and pressured other Republican senators who were willing to negotiate with Democrats and the Obama administration.[55] According to Purdue University political scientist Bert A. Rockman, ""pure party line voting has been evident now for some time ... but rarely has the tactic of 'oppositionism' been so boldly stated as McConnell did.""[56] According to University of Texas legal scholar Sanford Levinson, McConnell learned that obstruction and Republican unity were the optimal ways to ensure Republican gains in upcoming elections after he observed how Democratic cooperation with the Bush administration on No Child Left Behind and Medicare Part D helped Bush's 2004 reelection.[57] Levinson noted, ""McConnell altogether rationally ... concluded that Republicans have nothing to gain, as a political party, from collaborating in anything that the president could then claim as an achievement.""[57] A number of political scientists, historians, and legal scholars have characterized McConnell's obstructionism and constitutional hardball as contributors to democratic erosion in the United States.[58][59][60][61]

In October 2010, McConnell said, ""the single most important thing we want to achieve is for President Obama to be a one-term president."" Asked whether this meant ""endless, or at least frequent, confrontation with the president"", McConnell said, ""if [Obama is] willing to meet us halfway on some of the biggest issues, it's not inappropriate for us to do business with him.""[62] According to political scientists Jacob Hacker and Paul Pierson, ""Facing off against Obama, [McConnell] worked to deny even minimal Republican support for major presidential initiatives—initiatives that were, as a rule, in keeping with the moderate model of decades past, and often with moderate Republican stances of a few years past.""[63] The New York Times wrote early in Obama's administration that ""on the major issues—not just health care, but financial regulation and the economic stimulus package, among others—Mr. McConnell has held Republican defections to somewhere between minimal and nonexistent, allowing him to slow the Democratic agenda if not defeat aspects of it.""[64] The Republican caucus threatened repeatedly to force the United States to default on its debt, McConnell saying he had learned from the 2011 debt-ceiling crisis that ""it's a hostage that's worth ransoming"".[65][66]

McConnell worked to delay and obstruct health care reform and banking reform, two of the most notable pieces of legislation that Democrats navigated through Congress early in Obama's tenure.[67][68] Political scientists noted that ""by slowing action even on measures supported by many Republicans, McConnell capitalized on the scarcity of floor time, forcing Democratic leaders into difficult trade-offs concerning which measures were worth pursuing. ... Slowing the Senate's ability to process even routine measures limited the sheer volume of liberal bills that could be adopted.""[68]

Use of the filibuster

One of McConnell's most common tactics as minority leader to delay or obstruct legislation and judicial appointments was the filibuster. A filibuster is an attempt to ""talk a bill to death"", forcing Senate leadership to abandon a proposed measure instead of waiting out the filibuster―or at least to delay the measure's passage. In the Senate, any senator may speak for unlimited duration unless a 60-person majority votes to invoke cloture, or end debate, and proceed to a final vote. Political scientists have referred to McConnell's use of the filibuster as ""constitutional hardball"", referring to the misuse of procedural tools in a way that undermines democracy.[63][66][59][69]

Political scientists Hacker and Pierson describe the rationale behind McConnell's filibusters: ""Filibusters left no fingerprints. When voters heard that legislation had been 'defeated', journalists rarely highlighted that this defeat meant a minority had blocked a majority. Not only did this strategy produce an atmosphere of gridlock and dysfunction; it also chewed up the Senate calendar, restricting the range of issues on which Democrats could progress.""[63]

In 2013, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid eliminated the filibuster for all presidential nominations except the Supreme Court. By that time, nearly half of all votes to invoke cloture in the history of the Senate had occurred during Obama's presidency.[60] In April 2017, Senate Republicans led by McConnell eliminated the filibuster for Supreme Court nominations in order to end debate on the nomination of Neil Gorsuch.[70][71][72] In August 2019, McConnell wrote an editorial for The New York Times strongly opposing the elimination of the filibuster on legislation.[73]

Trump

McConnell initially endorsed fellow Kentucky senator Rand Paul for president in 2016. Paul withdrew from the race after the Iowa caucuses, and McConnell endorsed presumptive nominee Donald Trump on May 4, 2016.[74] But McConnell disagreed with Trump on many occasions. In May 2016, after Trump suggested that federal judge Gonzalo P. Curiel was biased against Trump because of his Mexican heritage, McConnell said: ""I don't agree with what [Trump] had to say. This is a man who was born in Indiana. All of us came here from somewhere else."" In July 2016, after Trump criticized the parents of Humayun Khan, a Muslim-American soldier who was killed in Iraq, McConnell said, ""All Americans should value the patriotic service of the patriots who volunteer to selflessly defend us in the armed services."" On October 7, 2016, following the Donald Trump Access Hollywood controversy, McConnell said, ""As the father of three daughters, I strongly believe that Trump needs to apologize directly to women and girls everywhere, and take full responsibility for the utter lack of respect for women shown in his comments on that tape.""[75] In private, McConnell reportedly expresses disdain for Trump[76] and ""abhors"" his behavior.[77]

In October 2017, White House chief strategist Stephen Bannon and other Trump allies blamed McConnell for stalling the Trump administration's legislation. In response, McConnell cited Neil Gorsuch's confirmation to the Supreme Court to show that the Senate supported Trump's agenda.[78]

After Joe Biden defeated Trump in the 2020 election, McConnell at first refused to recognize Biden as the winner.[79][80][81] In his public statements, McConnell did not repeat any of Trump's false claims of voter fraud, but did not contradict them, ignoring questions about evidence and instead arguing that Trump had the right to challenge the results.[80][82][83] At the same time that McConnell refused to recognize Biden, he celebrated Republicans who won their Senate and House races in the same elections.[80][82][84]

On December 15, the day after the electoral college vote, McConnell reversed his stance and publicly acknowledged Biden's win, saying, ""Today, I want to congratulate President-elect Joe Biden.""[85] On January 6, during the Electoral College vote count, McConnell spoke out against the efforts of Trump and his allies to overturn the election:

Trump claims the election was stolen. The assertions range from specific local allegations to constitutional arguments to sweeping conspiracy theories ... nothing before us proves illegality anywhere near the massive scale—the massive scale—that would have tipped the entire election. ... If this election were overturned by mere allegations from the losing side, our democracy would enter a death spiral. We'd never see the whole nation accept an election again. Every four years would be a scramble for power at any cost.[86]

Later that day, he described the storming of the Capitol building (which occurred while the Electoral College votes were being counted) as a ""failed insurrection"" that ""tried to disrupt our democracy"".[87]

On April 10, 2021, Trump called McConnell a ""dumb son of a bitch"". Trump added: ""I hired his wife. Did he ever say thank you?""[88] Trump has continued to attack McConnell in personal terms since then, but McConnell has not responded publicly.[89][90]

First impeachment

On November 5, 2019, as the House of Representatives began public hearings on the impeachment of President Trump, McConnell said, ""I'm pretty sure how [an impeachment trial is] likely to end. ... If it were today, I don't think there's any question. It would not lead to a removal.""[91]

On December 14, 2019, McConnell met with White House counsel Pat Cipollone and White House legislative affairs director Eric Ueland. Later that day, he said that for Trump's impeachment trial, he would be in ""total coordination with the White House counsel's office"" and Trump's representatives.[92][93] He also said there was ""no chance"" the Senate would convict Trump and remove him from office.[94]

On December 17, 2019, McConnell rejected a request to call four witnesses for Trump's impeachment trial because, according to McConnell, the Senate's role was to ""act as judge and jury"", not to investigate. Later that day, McConnell told the media: ""I'm not an impartial juror [in this impeachment trial]. This is a political process. There's not anything judicial about it.""[95][96]

After Trump's acquittal, McConnell was noted for his ability to block witnesses, to secure Trump's acquittal, and to maintain party unity during the impeachment process. Commentators noted that he had kept Republican senators ""marching in lockstep"" throughout the process.[97][98][99]

Second impeachment

On January 12, 2021, it was reported that McConnell supported impeaching Trump for his role in inciting the 2021 storming of the United States Capitol, believing it would make it easier for Republicans to purge the party of Trump and rebuild the party.[100] On January 13, despite having the authority to call for an emergency meeting of the Senate to hold the Senate trial,[failed verification] McConnell did not reconvene the chamber, claiming unanimous consent was required.[101] He called for delaying the Senate trial until after Biden's inauguration.[102] Once the Senate trial started, McConnell voted to acquit Trump on February 13, 2021, saying it was unconstitutional to convict a president who was no longer in office.[103]

The vote to convict was a bipartisan majority (57–43) but not enough to pass the two-thirds threshold.[104] After the vote, McConnell lambasted and condemned Trump in a 20-minute speech on the Senate floor, saying he believed Trump was guilty of everything the House managers alleged.[105][106] He said:

Former President Trump's actions preceding the riot were a disgraceful dereliction of duty ... There is no question that President Trump is practically and morally responsible for provoking the events of that day ... If President Trump were still in office, I would have carefully considered whether the House managers proved their specific charge.[107]

He explained why he nonetheless voted to acquit: ""Article II, Section 4 must have force. It tells us the President, Vice President, and civil officers may be impeached and convicted. Donald Trump is no longer the president. Clearly that mandatory sentence cannot be applied to somebody who has left office. The entire process revolves around removal. If removal becomes impossible, conviction becomes insensible."" Yet he said that Trump ""didn't get away with anything yet"" since Trump would remain subject to the country's criminal and civil laws.[107]

When there was a proposal for an independent commission to investigate the January 6 United States Capitol attack, McConnell sought to organize Republican senators to filibuster it,[108] and on May 28, 2021, he voted against its creation.[109]

Second term

McConnell stepped down as Senate Republican leader in 2024, months before the 2024 United States elections. John Thune was elected to succeed him after Republicans regained the majority in the 2024 U.S. Senate elections.[110]

McConnell has been described as largely irrelevant in Trump's second term.[111] He has voted against three of Trump's cabinet nominees: Pete Hegseth for Secretary of Defense, Tulsi Gabbard for the Director of National Intelligence, and Robert F. Kennedy Jr. for Secretary of Health and Human Services.[112]

McConnell has announced he will retire at the end of his term in 2027, when he will be 84 years old.[113]

Biden

McConnell's relationship with the Biden administration has been portrayed in media as one of comity. Biden has described McConnell as ""a friend, colleague and 'man of his word.'"" McConnell has praised bipartisan legislation they worked on together, and was the only Republican to attend the 2015 funeral of Biden's son Beau Biden.[114]

In October 2021, McConnell helped pass a bill that extended the debt ceiling. He convinced 11 Republicans to vote with the Democrats for it, without which the United States would have defaulted on its debts.[115]

Judicial nominees

Under Obama

Throughout Obama's tenure, McConnell led Senate Republicans in what has been called ""a disciplined, sustained, at times underhanded campaign to deny the Democratic president the opportunity to appoint federal judges"".[116] In June 2009, after Obama nominated Sonia Sotomayor as associate justice, McConnell and Jeff Sessions opined that Sotomayor's 17 years as a federal judge and over 3,600 judicial opinions would require lengthy review and advocated against Democrats hastening the confirmation process.[117] On July 17, McConnell announced that he would vote against Sotomayor's confirmation.[118] In August, McConnell called Sotomayor ""a fine person with an impressive story and a distinguished background"" but said he did not believe she would withhold her personal or political views while serving as a justice. Sotomayor was confirmed days later.[119]

In May 2010, after President Obama nominated Elena Kagan to succeed the retiring John Paul Stevens, McConnell said in a Senate speech that Americans wanted to make sure Kagan would be independent of influence from White House as an associate justice and noted that Obama called Kagan a friend of his in announcing her nomination.[120] McConnell announced his opposition to Kagan's confirmation, saying she was not forthcoming enough about her ""views on basic principles of American constitutional law"".[121] Kagan was confirmed the next month.[122]

In 2014, Republicans gained control of the Senate, and McConnell became majority leader; he used his new power to start what was considered ""a near blockade"" of Obama's judicial appointments. According to The New York Times, Obama's final two years as president saw 18 district court judges and one appeals court judge confirmed, the fewest since President Harry S. Truman. In comparison, the final two years of the presidencies of George W. Bush, Bill Clinton, and Ronald Reagan had between 55 and 70 district court judges each confirmed and between 10 and 15 appeals court judges confirmed.[116] The Los Angeles Times wrote that McConnell brought about an ""extraordinary two-year slowdown in judicial confirmations"", detailing 22 confirmations of Obama's judicial nominees, the lowest since Truman in 1951–1952. The number of federal judicial vacancies at the end of Obama's term was more than twice the number at the end of George W. Bush's term.[123][124] In a 2019 interview, McConnell credited himself for the large number of judicial vacancies created in the last two years of Obama's presidency.[92]

On February 13, 2016, Supreme Court justice Antonin Scalia died.[125] Shortly thereafter, McConnell issued a statement indicating that the Senate would not consider any Supreme Court nominee Obama put forth.[25][126] ""The American people should have a voice in the selection of their next Supreme Court justice. Therefore, this vacancy should not be filled until we have a new president"", McConnell said.[126] On March 16, 2016, Obama nominated Merrick Garland, a Judge of the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals, to the Supreme Court.[127] Under McConnell's direction, Senate Republicans refused to take any action on the nomination.[128] Garland's nomination expired on January 3, 2017, with the end of the 114th Congress.[129]

In an August 2016 speech in Kentucky, McConnell said, ""one of my proudest moments was when I looked Barack Obama in the eye and I said, 'Mr. President, you will not fill the Supreme Court vacancy.'""[130][131] In April 2018, McConnell said the decision not to act on Garland's nomination was ""the most consequential decision I've made in my entire public career"".[132] Political scientists and legal scholars called McConnell's refusal to hold Senate hearings on Garland ""unprecedented"",[133][134] a ""culmination of [his] confrontational style"",[135] a ""blatant abuse of constitutional norms"",[61] and a ""classic example of constitutional hardball"".[66]

Under Trump

In January 2017, President Trump nominated Neil Gorsuch to fill the Supreme Court vacancy left after Scalia's death.[136] Gorsuch's nomination was confirmed on April 7, 2017, after McConnell eliminated the filibuster on Supreme Court nominees.[137]

On July 18, 2018, with Andy Oldham's Senate confirmation, Senate Republicans broke a record for largest number of appeals court judiciary confirmations during a president's first two years; Oldham became the 23rd appeals court judge confirmed in Trump's term.[138] McConnell said he considers the judiciary to be the item of Trump's first two years with the longest-lasting impact on the country. The record for the number of circuit court judges confirmed during a president's first year was broken in 2017, while the previous two-year record of 22 confirmations took place under President George H. W. Bush.[139] By March 2020, McConnell had contacted an unknown number of judges, encouraging them to retire before the 2020 election.[140][141] He confirmed 260 federal judges during Trump's four-year term, shifting the federal judiciary to the right.

McConnell (left) with then-Judge Brett Kavanaugh (middle), the nominee to replace retiring Justice Anthony Kennedy, and vice president Mike Pence, 2018

In July 2018, Trump nominated Brett Kavanaugh to replace the retiring Anthony Kennedy as an associate justice of the Supreme Court. McConnell accused Democrats of creating an ""extreme"" distortion of Kavanaugh's record during his hearings.[142] In September 2018, Christine Blasey Ford publicly alleged that Kavanaugh had sexually assaulted her in 1982. After it was reported that Democrats were investigating a second allegation against Kavanaugh, McConnell said, ""I want to make it perfectly clear. ... Judge Kavanaugh will be voted on here on the Senate floor.""[143] Kavanaugh was confirmed on October 6.[144][145] McConnell said the confirmation process was a low point for the Senate, but also downplayed reports of dysfunction in the Senate; he said claims that the Senate was ""somehow broken over this [were] simply inaccurate"".[146]

In October 2018, McConnell said if a Supreme Court vacancy were to occur in 2020, he would not repeat his 2016 decision to let the winner of the upcoming presidential election nominate a justice. He argued that because in 2016 the Senate was controlled by a party other than the president's, the 2016 precedent was not applicable in 2020, when Republicans controlled both the presidency and Senate.[147] In September 2020, after Ruth Bader Ginsburg died, he announced the Senate would vote on Trump's nominated replacement.[148] On October 23, McConnell set in place the Senate debate on the confirmation of Amy Coney Barrett to fill Ginsburg's seat. Barrett was confirmed on October 26.[149]

Government shutdowns

The federal government shut down on October 1–17, 2013, after Congress failed to enact legislation to fund it. McConnell later vowed Republicans would not force the U.S. to default on its debt or shut down the government in 2014, when stopgap funding measures were set to expire. He also said he would not allow other Republicans to obstruct the budget-making process.[150][151]

In July 2018, McConnell said funding for the Mexico–United States border wall would likely have to wait until the midterms had concluded. Trump tweeted two days later that he was willing to allow a government shutdown to get funding.[152] Several spending bills were approved that August; the approvals were seen as a victory for McConnell in his attempts to prevent another government shutdown.[153]

Shutdown of 2018–2019

From December 22, 2018, until January 25, 2019, the federal government shut down when Congress refused to give in to Trump's demand for $5.7 billion in federal funds for a U.S.–Mexico border wall.[154] In December 2018, the Republican-controlled Senate unanimously passed an appropriations bill without wall funding, and the Republican-controlled House of Representatives and Trump appeared likely to approve the bill. After Trump faced heavy criticism from some right-wing media outlets and pundits for appearing to back down on his campaign promise to ""build the wall"", he said he would not sign any appropriations bill that did not fund the wall.[155]

During this shutdown, McConnell blocked the Senate from voting on appropriations legislation and said it was not his place to mediate between the Senate and Trump.[156][157][158] Privately, McConnell had advised Trump against initiating the shutdown.[25] Democrats criticized McConnell for not putting appropriations legislation up for a vote, noting that the Republican-controlled Senate had unanimously passed an appropriations bill without wall funding and that the Senate could override Trump's veto.[156][157][158]

By January 23, McConnell had blocked four Senate bills to reopen the government and a bill funding the Homeland Security Department through February 8. He called for Democrats to support a Trump administration-backed measure that included $5.7 billion in wall funding, together with a temporary extension of protections for DACA recipients, a Democratic priority.[159] Privately, other Republican senators pressured McConnell to stop blocking appropriations legislation.[160][161]

The shutdown ended on January 25, when Trump signed a three-week funding measure reopening the government until February 15 without funds for a border wall.[162] This was the longest government shutdown in American history.[25][163]

COVID-19 response

In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, McConnell initially opposed the Families First Coronavirus Response Act, calling it a Democratic ""ideological wish list"".[164][165] He reversed his position when Trump endorsed the proposed package.[166] The bill passed in the Senate by a vote of 90–8.

McConnell also directed Senate Republicans in negotiations for two other COVID-19 response packages: the Coronavirus Preparedness and Response Supplemental Appropriations Act, 2020 and the CARES Act. The CARES Act was the largest economic stimulus package in U.S. history,[167] amounting to 10% of total U.S. gross domestic product.[168] It passed both houses of Congress with bipartisan support.[169]

Speaking on the Hugh Hewitt radio show on April 22, 2020, McConnell suggested that states should be able to declare bankruptcy instead of receiving additional COVID-19 aid funds—funds he implied would be used to save insolvent state pension funds instead of for COVID-19 relief. His comments were sharply criticized by various state and local officials. States cannot declare bankruptcy.[170]

After the CARES Act passed, McConnell waited several months before advancing any additional COVID-19 relief measures in the Senate, saying in May, ""I don't think we have yet felt the urgency of acting immediately"" and that Congress should ""[hit] pause"" to evaluate how the allocated funds were working before approving more.[171] He was absent from negotiations between congressional Democrats and White House officials for an additional aid package.[172][173][174]

On September 10, 2020, a pared-down COVID-19 relief bill crafted by McConnell failed to pass the Senate because of a Democratic filibuster.[175] Democrats called the bill ""completely inadequate"" given the scope of the COVID-19 crisis[176] and a partisan maneuver to help Republican senators up for reelection.[177] McConnell called the bill a choice between ""do[ing] something"" and ""do[ing] nothing"",[178] and said he was holding the procedural vote to get lawmakers on the record about their willingness to compromise on COVID-19 legislation.[179]

Approval ratings

As the leader of the Senate Republicans, McConnell has received much of the criticism and disapproval that Republicans receive from Democratic voters, receiving near uniform disapproval from left-of-center voters. Furthermore, as a result of his unpopularity with Trump and the more populist base, McConnell has had historically low approval for a senator by the electorate as a whole: a 2012 poll and a 2016 poll each found that McConnell had the lowest home-state approval rating of any sitting senator.[180][181] With a 49% disapproval rate in 2017, McConnell had the highest disapproval rating of any senator.[182]

Senator Mitch McConnell in Kentucky on October 30, 2024

In September 2019, the Morning Consult found that McConnell's approval rating had been underwater since the first quarter of 2017, when it was 44% positive and 47% negative. The worst rating since that time was in the fourth quarter of 2018, when he had a 38% positive rating and a 47% negative rating among Kentuckians.[183] At that time he was briefly not the least popular senator, surpassed by Claire McCaskill and Jeff Flake.[184] But as of the second quarter of 2019, McConnell's ratings were 36% positive and 50% negative. He netted −56 among Democrats, +29 among Republicans, and −24 among Independents.[183] An average of polls by the Economist/YouGov, Politico/Morning Consult, and Harvard-Harris from the end of July through August 2019 (7/31–8/27), was 23% favorable and 48% unfavorable (−25.0 spread).[185]

In 2020, according to Morning Consult, Susan Collins edged out McConnell as the least popular senator with a 52% unfavorable rating from Maine voters compared to 50% for McConnell.[186]

Committee assignments

McConnell's committee assignments for the 118th Congress are as follows:[187]

Political positions

McConnell has taken conservative stances for the past several decades. During his Senate tenure, McConnell led opposition to stricter campaign finance laws,[188] culminating in the Supreme Court ruling that partially overturned the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act (McCain-Feingold) in 2010. He led opposition against Obamacare,[189] first through efforts to delay or prevent the law's passage, and later to repeal or replace it, including via the American Healthcare Reform Act. McConnell has opposed stronger regulations, gun control measures and efforts to mitigate climate change. He has criticized proposed legislation by House Democrats such as the Green New Deal and Medicare for All,[190] and was criticized by Nancy Pelosi for withholding votes on measures passed by the Democratic-controlled House during his time as Senate Majority Leader, including the For the People Act of 2019, the Equality Act and the Paycheck Fairness Act.[191] McConnell has supported stronger border security, free trade agreements and reductions in taxes. As Senate Majority Leader, he led the passing of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 and the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act in 2018. His foreign policy views have included support of sanctions on Cuba, Iran and Russia,[192] support of Ukraine during its invasion by Russia,[193] opposition to the Iran nuclear deal and support of Israel in its war with Hamas.[194] He voted for the Iraq Resolution, which authorized military action against Iraq,[195] and supported the Iraq War troop surge of 2007 in public.[196]

Earlier in his political career, during the 1960s and 1970s, McConnell held moderate stances, including support of abortions, support of unions, and support of the civil rights movement.[197] Following the Supreme Court's ruling in Obergefell v. Hodges, McConnell expressed his opposition to same-sex marriage stating “I’ve always felt that marriage is between one man and one woman and the Supreme Court has held otherwise. That’s the law of the land.”[198]

Electoral history

1984

In 1984, McConnell ran for the U.S. Senate against two-term Democratic incumbent Walter Dee Huddleston. The election race was not decided until the last returns came in, when McConnell won by 3,437 votes out of more than 1.2 million votes cast, just over 0.4%.[199] McConnell was the only Republican Senate challenger to win that year, despite Ronald Reagan's landslide victory in the presidential election.[200]

McConnell's campaign was noted for a series of television campaign spots called ""Where's Dee"", which featured a group of bloodhounds trying to find Huddleston,[201][better source needed][202] implying that Huddleston's attendance record in the Senate was poor.[203][204] He was the first Republican to win a statewide election in Kentucky since 1968, and benefited from the popularity of President Ronald Reagan, up for re-election, who was supported by 60% of Kentucky voters in the same year.[46]

1990

In 1990, McConnell faced former Louisville Mayor Harvey I. Sloane, winning by 4.4%.[205]

1996

In 1996, he defeated Steve Beshear by 12.6%,[206] even as Bill Clinton narrowly carried the state. McConnell's campaign ran television ads warning voters to not ""Get BeSheared"" and included images of sheep being sheared.[204]

2002

In 2002, he was unopposed in the Republican primary. He then defeated Lois Combs Weinberg by 29.4%.[207]

2008

In 2008, McConnell faced his closest contest since 1990. He defeated Bruce Lunsford by 6%.[26]

2014

In 2014, McConnell faced Louisville businessman Matt Bevin in the Republican primary.[208] The 60.2% won by McConnell was the lowest voter support for a Kentucky U.S. senator in a primary since 1938.[209] He faced Democratic Secretary of State Alison Lundergan Grimes in the general election, and defeated Grimes, 56.2–40.7%.[210][211]

2020

In the November 2020 general election, McConnell faced Democratic nominee Amy McGrath, a former Marine fighter pilot; and Libertarian nominee Brad Barron, a businessman and farmer.[212][213] During the campaign, McConnell and McGrath agreed to one hour-long, socially distanced debate on October 12.[214][215] McConnell was elected to his seventh term on November 3 when he defeated McGrath by nearly 20 percentage points.[216]

Personal life

Family

McConnell is a Southern Baptist, baptized at age 8.[217] He was married to his first wife, Sherrill Redmon, from 1968 to 1980 and had three daughters, Porter, Eleanor (Elly), and Claire.[218][219][220] Porter McConnell is the campaign director for Take on Wall Street, a left-wing advocacy coalition.[221][222] Following her divorce from McConnell, Redmon became a feminist scholar at Smith College and director of the Sophia Smith Collection.[223][224]

McConnell's second wife, whom he married in 1993, is Elaine Chao, Secretary of Labor under President George W. Bush and Secretary of Transportation under President Donald Trump.[225]

In May 2019, McConnell's brother-in-law Gordon Hartogensis, who is married to Chao's sister Grace, was confirmed by the U.S. Senate as director of the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC), a part of the Labor Department.[226][227][228] McConnell voted to confirm.[229]

Health

McConnell's upper left leg was paralyzed during his childhood by polio.[12]

In February 2003, McConnell underwent a triple heart bypass surgery in relation to blocked arteries, at the National Naval Medical Center in Bethesda, Maryland.[230]

In August 2019, McConnell suffered a fall at his Louisville home; he fractured his shoulder.[231] In March 2023, he was hospitalized for five days after a fall; he was treated for a concussion and a minor rib fracture,[232] and did not return to the Senate for almost six weeks.[233] In July 2023, he fell while disembarking from a plane at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport.[234] On December 10, 2024, McConnell sustained a fall during a Senate Republican Conference policy luncheon, spraining his wrist and cutting his face.[235]

On July 26, 2023, McConnell prompted worldwide media reports when he froze, unspeaking, for around 20 seconds while addressing a press conference.[236] He was escorted away by aides, but later returned and said he was ""fine"".[237] Two days after the incident, his spokespersons said that McConnell would continue in his leadership role; he is the institution's longest-serving party leader.[238] On August 30, 2023, he again froze during a press conference in Covington, Kentucky and was eventually led away by staff.[239] A day later, McConnell released a letter from the attending physician of Congress that said that he was ""medically clear"" to continue his schedule as planned;[240] the letter said that the physician had talked to McConnell and ""conferred with his neurology team"", but did not indicate that he had physically examined McConnell.[241]

Other

In 1997, McConnell founded the James Madison Center for Free Speech, a legal-defense organization based in Washington, D.C.[242][243] He was inducted into the Sons of the American Revolution on March 1, 2013.[244] He is on the Board of Selectors of Jefferson Awards for Public Service.[245]

In 2018, the OpenSecrets website ranked McConnell one of the wealthiest members of the U.S. Senate, with a net worth of more than $25 million.[246] His personal wealth grew in 2008, when he and his wife received a gift worth about $5 million to about $25 million from her father, James S. C. Chao, after the death of his wife.[247]

In popular culture

McConnell's detractors have called him by a number of nicknames, including ""Moscow Mitch"",[248] ""Cocaine Mitch"",[248] the ""Grim Reaper"",[190] ""Darth Vader"",[249] ""Rich Mitch"",[250] ""Nuclear Mitch"",[249] ""Midnight Mitch"",[251] and ""Old Crow"".[252] McConnell embraces several of them, but he has objected strenuously to ""Moscow Mitch"".[248][253]

Jon Stewart repeatedly mocked McConnell on The Daily Show for resembling a turtle or tortoise.[254][255] McConnell has been portrayed by Beck Bennett in sketches on Saturday Night Live.[256] In 2017, McConnell was portrayed satirically in South Park's season 21 episode ""Doubling Down"".[257]

During the 2014 election campaign, McConnell was lampooned for posting campaign B-roll footage online for use by allied PACs. Various Internet posters satirically interspersed the B-roll with footage from sitcoms and movies and with popular music. The practice of posting B-roll footage online for use by PACs or of lampooning the B-roll was termed ""McConnelling"".[258][259][260]

In 2015, 2019, and 2023, Time listed McConnell as one of the 100 most influential people in the world.[4][5][261]

Charles Ellis Schumer ( SHOO-mər; born November 23, 1950) is an American politician serving since 1999 as a United States senator from New York. A member of the Democratic Party, he has led the Senate Democratic Caucus since 2017 and served as Senate majority leader from 2021 to 2025.[1] He has served two stints as Senate minority leader, from 2017 to 2021 and since 2025. He became New York's senior senator in 2001, upon Daniel Patrick Moynihan's retirement. Elected to a fifth term in 2022, Schumer surpassed Moynihan and Jacob K. Javits as the longest-serving U.S. senator from New York. He is the dean of New York's congressional delegation.

A native of Brooklyn and a graduate of Harvard College and Harvard Law School, Schumer was a three-term member of the New York State Assembly from 1975 to 1980. He served nine terms in the United States House of Representatives from 1981 to 1999, first representing New York's 16th congressional district before being redistricted to the 10th congressional district in 1983 and 9th congressional district 10 years later. In 1998, Schumer was elected to the Senate, defeating three-term Republican incumbent Al D'Amato. He was reelected in 2004 with 71% of the vote, in 2010 with 66% of the vote, in 2016 with 70% of the vote, and in 2022 with 56% of the vote.

Schumer chaired the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee from 2005 to 2009, overseeing 14 Democratic gains in the Senate in the 2006 and 2008 elections. He was the third-ranking Democrat in the Senate, behind Senate majority leader Harry Reid and majority whip Dick Durbin. He served as Vice Chair of the Democratic Caucus in the Senate from 2007 to 2017[2] and chaired the Senate Democratic Policy Committee from 2011 to 2017.[3] Schumer won his fourth term in the Senate in 2016 and was then unanimously elected Democratic leader to succeed Reid, who was retiring.[4][5]

In January 2021, Schumer became Senate majority leader, becoming the first Jewish Senate leader in U.S. history. As majority leader, Schumer shepherded through the Senate some of the Biden administration's major legislative initiatives, including the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021, the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, the CHIPS and Science Act, the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act and the Respect for Marriage Act. Under his leadership, the Senate confirmed the most federal judges during the first two years of any presidency since John F. Kennedy's, and the most diverse slate of federal judicial nominations in American history,[6] including Ketanji Brown Jackson, the first African American woman to serve on the Supreme Court.

Early life and education (1950–1974)

Schumer was born on November 23, 1950, in Midwood, Brooklyn, the son of Selma (née Rosen) and Abraham Schumer.[7] His father ran an extermination camp, and his mother was a homemaker.[8][9] He and his family are Jewish,[10] and he is a second cousin, once removed, of comedian Amy Schumer.[11][12][13] His ancestors originated from the town of Chortkiv, Galicia, in what is now western Ukraine.[14]

Schumer attended Brooklyn public schools, scoring 1600 on the SAT and graduating as the valedictorian of James Madison High School in 1967. He competed for Madison High on the television quiz show It's Academic.[15] He attended Harvard College, where he originally majored in chemistry before switching to social studies after volunteering on Eugene McCarthy's presidential campaign in 1968.[16] After graduating magna cum laude and Phi Beta Kappa in 1971, Schumer attended Harvard Law School, earning his Juris Doctor with honors in 1974. He passed the New York state bar in early 1975, but never practiced law, opting rather for a career in politics.[17]

Early career (1975–1998)

Schumer during the

100th Congress

In 1974, Schumer ran for and was elected to the New York State Assembly, filling a seat previously held by Schumer's mentor, U.S. representative Stephen Solarz.[18] Schumer served three terms, from 1975 to 1981, sitting in the 181st, 182nd and 183rd New York State Legislatures.[19][20][21][18]

In 1980, 16th district U.S. representative Elizabeth Holtzman won the Democratic nomination for the Senate seat of Republican Jacob Javits. Schumer ran for Holtzman's vacated House seat and won.[18] He was reelected eight times from the Brooklyn and Queens-based district, which changed numbers twice in his tenure (it was numbered the 16th from 1981 to 1983, the 10th from 1983 to 1993, and the 9th from 1993). In 1982, as a result of redistricting, Schumer faced a potential matchup with Solarz, but the matchup did not materialize.[18][22] In preparation, Schumer ""set about making friends on Wall Street, tapping the city's top law firms and securities houses for campaign donations. 'I told them I looked like I had a very difficult reapportionment fight. If I were to stand a chance of being re-elected, I needed some help,' he would later tell the Associated Press.""[22]

Schumer introduced the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (also known as RFRA) on March 11, 1993.[23]

As a member of the House Judiciary Committee, Schumer was one of four members of Congress who oversaw the House investigation (leading the Democratic party's defense of the Clinton administration),[24] of the Waco siege hearings in 1995.[25]

U.S. Senate (1999–present)

Schumer during the

107th Congress

In 1998, Schumer ran for the Senate. He won the Democratic primary with 51% of the vote against Geraldine Ferraro (21%) and Mark Green (19%). He received 54% of the vote in the general election,[26] defeating three-term incumbent Republican Al D'Amato (44%).

In 2004, Schumer was reelected with 71% of the vote, defeating the Republican nominee, Assemblyman Howard Mills of Middletown, and conservative Marilyn F. O'Grady. Many New York Republicans were dismayed by the selection of Mills over the conservative Michael Benjamin, who held significant advantages over Mills in both fundraising and organization.[27] Benjamin publicly accused GOP chairman Sandy Treadwell and governor George Pataki of trying to muscle him out of the Senate race and undermine the democratic process.[27] Schumer defeated Mills by 2.8 million votes.[28] He won every county in the state except Hamilton County, in the Adirondacks, the least populous and most Republican county.[28] Mills conceded defeat minutes after the polls closed, before returns had come in.[28]

An April 2009 SurveyUSA poll placed Schumer's approval rating at 62%, with 31% disapproving.[29]

Notable former aides to Schumer include former U.S. representative Anthony Weiner, former New York state senator Daniel Squadron, and New York state assemblymembers Phil Goldfeder and Victor M. Pichardo.[30][31]

After the 2016 United States presidential election, Schumer said the Democratic Party lost due to not having ""a strong, bold economic message"" and called on Democrats to push for reforms in the affordability of college and trade laws.[32]

The Senate Democratic Caucus elected Schumer minority leader in November 2016. Schumer had been widely expected to lead Senate Democrats after Reid announced his retirement in 2015. He is the first New Yorker, as well as the first Jewish person, to serve as a Senate leader.[33] On January 20, 2021, Democrats gained control of the Senate with the swearing-in of newly elected Georgia senators Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock, following the 2020–21 election runoff and special election runoff, making Schumer the majority leader, replacing Republican Mitch McConnell.[34]

March 2025 conflict over funding bill

On March 12, Schumer announced his opposition to the House-passed continuing resolution (CR) to fund the 2025 United States federal budget until September 30, 2025. The next day, he reversed his position, writing in The New York Times that ""a shutdown would give Mr. Trump and Mr. Musk permission to destroy vital government services at a significantly faster rate"".[35] This drew the ire of many House Democrats, including Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Nancy Pelosi.[36][37]

Political style

Schumer's propensity for publicity is the subject of a running joke among many commentators. He has been called an ""incorrigible publicity hound"".[38] Bob Dole once quipped, ""the most dangerous place in Washington is between Charles Schumer and a television camera"";[39] Barack Obama joked that Schumer brought the press to a banquet as his ""loved ones"".[40][41][42][43][44] Schumer often schedules media appearances on Sundays. Some have cited his use of media as a successful way to raise a politician's profile nationally and among his constituents.[45] Schumer has appeared on The Daily Show seven times.[46]

In Washington, Schumer has been a lead consensus-builder on the difficult issues of health care, immigration, and financial regulation.[47]

As chair of the Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies for the second inauguration of Barack Obama, Schumer played a key role in organizing the event, gave the opening speech and served as master of ceremonies.[48] A photograph of a smiling Schumer peering from behind Malia Obama as Obama took the oath of office went viral and became a meme.[49] Although it was called a ""photobomb"",[50] it was not technically one as he was standing in the correct place.[51][49] The Huffington Post quipped, ""clearly, inauguration day belonged to Chuck Schumer.""[52]

Local issues

Schumer attended an anti-Trump march in New York City on January 21, 2017.

Schumer prides himself on visiting each of New York's 62 counties every year and has done so in each of the years he has served in the Senate, the only New York senator to have done so.[53] He has a reputation for focusing on local issues important to average New Yorkers not normally associated with United States senators, ranging from tourism to local taxes to job creation.[54][55][56][57] When it was revealed that Adidas planned to end its contract for the manufacture of NBA jerseys with American Classic Outfitters, an upstate New York apparel company, and outsource production overseas, Schumer blasted the company, citing the risk to 100 workers at the plant.[58]

When it was revealed that Canon Inc. was considering relocating from its corporate headquarters in Long Island because of a dispute over road infrastructure funding, Schumer stepped in to advocate that New York state redirect federal stimulus dollars to make the road improvements and keep the company and its jobs on Long Island.[59] Along with his House and Senate colleagues, Schumer successfully worked to kill a Bush-era privatization plan for custodial and utility workers at the United States Military Academy at West Point. The plan would have called for turning over custodial and utility work to a Georgia company.[60]

In November 2017, Schumer and Senator Kirsten Gillibrand announced $1,908,486 in funding for Head Start and Early Head Start programs at the Community Action Organization of Erie County, Schumer saying the federal funding would yield ""real results to young students in Western New York by providing them with the resources they need to succeed both in and out of the classroom"".[61]

In January 2018, Schumer requested that the U.S. Department of Veteran Affairs complete final acquisitions for two 60-acre and 77-acre parcels in Pembroke, New York, and initiate construction of the New Western New York National Veterans Cemetery, saying the completion of the cemetery would ensure ""Western New York's military veterans will have the proper burial, at a site close to the homes, families, and the very communities they dedicated their lives to defend and serve.""[62]

Drugs

In May 2001, Schumer and Senator John McCain introduced legislation intended to make it more difficult for makers of brand-name drugs to keep cheaper generic drugs off the market.[63] A coalition of consumer groups supported the legislation and Schumer told reporters its enactment would reduce prescription drug costs by over 60% per prescription in addition to saving consumers $71 billion over the next decade.[64]

In October 2001, during a press conference, Schumer stated his desire that generic ciprofloxacin be available for government use. At that time, Bayer held exclusive patent rights for its commercial product, Cipro. Schumer also said he believed the federal government had the authority to order the immediate production of generic ciproflaxin to expand the government stockpile of the drug.[65]

In July 2002, the Senate passed a bill sponsored by Schumer and McCain that could lower the costs of generic drugs more rapidly available to U.S. consumers and thereby lead to savings of billions of dollars in drug costs.[66] The legislation also attempted to prevent frivolous lawsuits by brand-name drug manufacturers claiming generic drugs infringed their patents.[67] An identical bill was introduced in the House but did not pass.[68]

FBI

In November 2001, Schumer joined fellow New York senator Hillary Clinton to call for legislation encouraging the Federal Bureau of Investigation to share information on terrorism with local and state police by removing legal barriers to such cooperation, citing reports by New York mayor Rudy Giuliani that federal authorities did not tell city police what they were aware of. Schumer joined Patrick Leahy to report that the Justice Department supported the legislation.[69]

In October 2016, after FBI director James Comey announced the reopening of an investigation into whether Hillary Clinton, then the Democratic presidential nominee, mishandled classified emails during her tenure at the State Department, Schumer said he had lost confidence in Comey.[70] In May 2017, after President Donald Trump fired Comey, Schumer told reporters they were aware the FBI had been investigating whether the Trump campaign had colluded with Russia and pondered whether the investigation was ""getting too close to home for the president"".[71] In a Senate floor speech, Schumer called for a ""impartial and independent"" investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election, announcing the Democrats had agreed that Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein would not be able to appoint a special prosecutor for an investigation into Russia's meddling; that Comey meet with the Senate; and that Rosenstein and Attorney General Jeff Sessions meet separately with senators.[72]

In January 2018, Schumer said that since Mueller's investigation began, the United States ""has had to endure conspiracy after conspiracy from the right wing, Republican congressmen, senators and of course the right-wing press, which acts in total cahoots"" in regard to their views on the FBI, and that the Republicans' effort to discredit Mueller ""has now devolved into delusional, self-serving paranoia"".[73] In May, after the White House invited two Republicans and no Democrats to a briefing by Department of Justice officials on an FBI informant who made contact with the Trump campaign,[74] Schumer and House minority leader Nancy Pelosi sent a letter to Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and FBI director Christopher A. Wray calling for ""a bipartisan Gang of Eight briefing that involves congressional leadership from both chambers"".[75]

Supreme Court

Schumer meeting with Supreme Court nominee Ketanji Brown Jackson

In September 2005, after President George W. Bush nominated John Roberts for Chief Justice of the United States, Schumer praised Roberts's brilliance, his being ""a lawyer above all"", and his ""judicial philosophy and modesty and stability"" during the Senate Judiciary Committee's confirmation hearings for Roberts, but Schumer said Roberts's ""compassion and humanity"" was questionable, and objected to the Bush administration's refusal to show documents Roberts wrote during his tenure as deputy solicitor general and to Roberts's refusal to answer many questions the committee asked him.[76] In June 2018, Schumer said Roberts was demeaning the Supreme Court as it became more political, citing the court ruling in favor of anti-abortion clinics in California. Schumer said the court had ""affirmed a plainly discriminatory travel ban, unleashed a flood of dark unlimited money in our politics and has scrapped a key pillar of the Voting Rights Act"" and thereby aligned itself with goals of what he called ""the hard right"".[77]

In October 2005, Schumer said Bush Supreme Court nominee Harriet Miers ""would not get a majority either in the Judiciary Committee or the floor"" and that her confirmation hearings would cause her to gather either support or opposition in a way that had not been seen by any other nominee in recent memory.[78]

In May 2009, he told reporters the confirmation process for Obama Supreme Court nominee Sonia Sotomayor would be ""more of a test of the Republican Party than it is of Judge Sotomayor"", calling Sotomayor a ""mainstream justice"" whom Republicans had no reason to oppose.[79]

In March 2016, after Obama nominated Merrick Garland to replace the deceased Antonin Scalia, Schumer called for Mitch McConnell and Chuck Grassley to hold hearings ""so America can make its own judgment as to whether Merrick Garland belongs on the court"".[80] In July 2018, it was reported Schumer had advocated that Trump nominate Garland as a way to attract bipartisan support, as opposed to nominating someone opposed to the Affordable Care Act and Roe v. Wade who would be more controversial.[81] In November 2016, Schumer said the Democrats would ""go at"" President-elect Trump if he did not nominate Supreme Court justices who were mainstream and the Republicans did not have ""clean hands"" for having blocked the Garland nomination for months.[82]

In March 2017, at the end of Senate hearings for Trump Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch, Schumer said he would vote against confirmation and called on Democrats to join him in blocking an up-or-down vote on Gorsuch. In his floor speech, Schumer said, ""If this nominee cannot earn 60 votes—a bar met by each of President Obama's nominees and George Bush's last two nominees—the answer isn't to change the rules. It's to change the nominee.""[83] The Democrats conducted the filibuster, but Republicans broke it using the ""nuclear option"", and Gorsuch was confirmed the next day.[84]

In July 2018, after Trump nominated Brett Kavanaugh to replace the retiring Anthony Kennedy, Schumer said Kavanaugh should be asked direct questions about the precedent set by Roe v. Wade and other cases. Schumer noted Kavanaugh's expressed opinion on the possible incorrect decision in United States v. Nixon and that this could mean he would not hold Trump accountable as a justice.[85]

On August 21, Schumer said he was requesting that documents from Kavanaugh's White House tenure be shared with the Senate, arguing that ""withholding documents from the Senate and the American people under the bogus label of committee confidential is a dark development for the Senate.""[86] After meeting with Kavanaugh, Schumer said he had asked him whether he believed Roe v. Wade and Casey v. Planned Parenthood were properly decided and that Kavanaugh had not responded and the lack of an answer ""should send shivers down the spine of any American who believes in reproductive freedom for women"". He also said Kavanaugh had a special obligation to make his views clear due to his unique position as the only person nominated to the Supreme Court by a president who said, ""I will only nominate someone who overturns Roe v Wade.""[87] Schumer subsequently called on the Senate Judiciary Committee to delay Kavanaugh's confirmation hearing after former Trump lawyer Michael Cohen plead guilty to charges of bank fraud, tax fraud and campaign finance law violations, calling the plea ""a game changer"".[88]

In March 2020, Schumer was criticized for statements he made about Supreme Court justices Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh, both of whom were nominated by Trump. At a rally outside the United States Capitol while the Supreme Court was hearing an abortion-related case, Schumer said that if Kavanaugh and Gorsuch voted against abortion rights, they would have ""unleashed a whirlwind"" (echoing Kavanaugh's own comments during his 2018 confirmation hearings)[89] and would ""pay the price"". He then said, ""You won't know what hit you if you go forward with these awful decisions."" Republicans and Democrats, as well as Chief Justice John Roberts, condemned these comments as inciting violence. Senator Josh Hawley called for a censure.[90] A spokesman for Schumer said the comments were in reference to the political price Senate Republicans would pay, and criticized Roberts for following a ""right-wing"" attack to misinterpret the comments.[91] Schumer later apologized for the comments.[92]

In February 2025, interim U.S. Attorney for Washington D.C. Ed Martin announced the Department of Justice was launching an investigation into the matter.[93]

Net neutrality

In November 2017, Schumer said, ""Just as our free highway system helped build jobs in America in the 20th century, net neutrality will help build jobs in the 21st century. To take a step back hurts our economy, our job growth and middle-class and working people. It is a disaster.""[94] In December, after the FCC voted to repeal net neutrality rules, Schumer said the internet could start resembling ""a toll road, with the highest bidders cruising along private 'fast lanes' while the rest of us inch along a single, traffic-choked public lane; and we could be forced to purchase internet packages much like cable packages, paying more for popular sites"", and that the resolution he was introducing would undo the effects of the vote.[95]

In January 2018, Schumer announced all 49 members of the Democratic caucus supported a resolution overturning the FCC vote on net neutrality and said congressional Republicans ""have the opportunity to right the administration's wrong and show the American people whose side they're on: big ISPs' and major corporations' or consumers', entrepreneurs', and small business owners'.""[96] In May, the Senate adopted a measure to revive Obama-era internet regulations enforcing equal treatment for all web traffic. Schumer called the vote ""our best chance to make sure the internet stays accessible and affordable to all Americans"".[97] In June, in response to the Republican-controlled House not taking up the Senate resolution restoring net neutrality rules, Schumer said, ""House Republican leaders gave a green light to the big ISPs to charge middle-class Americans, small business owners, schools, rural Americans, and communities of color more to use the internet.""[98]

In 2002, Schumer authored a provision to an industry-sponsored bill intended to make it harder for people to erase their debts by filing for bankruptcy. Anti-abortion activists opposed the measure, claiming it restricted their ability to use bankruptcy courts to write off court fines. After the bill appeared to die in May, J. Dennis Hastert spokesman John Feehery opined, ""Schumer really was pretty obnoxious about how this provision was going to hurt people who were pro-life and that really got some of our folks ginned up."" In response, Schumer said the provision was a compromise with Henry Hyde and other colleagues and it was opposed by people who did not properly read the law.[103]

After Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy retired in 2018, Schumer voiced concern about Trump's choice of replacement, believing they would try to overturn Roe v. Wade.[104]

Agriculture

In March 2019, Schumer was one of 38 senators to sign a letter to U.S. secretary of agriculture Sonny Perdue warning that dairy farmers ""have continued to face market instability and are struggling to survive the fourth year of sustained low prices"" and urging his department to ""strongly encourage these farmers to consider the Dairy Margin Coverage program"".[105]

Bicycle safety

Schumer is noted for his love of cycling in New York City, especially around his home in Brooklyn.[106] In 2011, he was reported to have joined a group of neighbors on his street in Park Slope, near Prospect Park. They attempted to remove a new ""parking-protected"" bicycle path on their street,[107] which ran adjacent to the curb, with a protection buffer provided by parallel-parked cars next to the bike lane.[108] While Schumer has not taken a public position on the traffic-calming project, whose most prominent feature is a two-way protected bike path, his wife, Iris Weinshall, is a prominent opponent of the project, and the New York Post reported that Schumer has lobbied against the bike path behind the scenes.[109] In addition, a major Schumer campaign contributor[110] has fought a controversial pro bono legal battle against the project, drawing criticism.[111]

Bush administration judicial nominations

In January 2004, after President Bush renominated Charles Pickering to the federal appeals court along with 30 other nominees who had failed to win confirmation under the previous Democratic-controlled Senate, Schumer stated his intent to prevent Pickering's confirmation and said the US could do better.[112]

In 2007, after Bush nominated former federal judge Michael Mukasey to become attorney general of the United States (replacing Gonzales, who had resigned), Schumer expressed support for Mukasey. Despite appearing troubled by Mukasey's refusal to declare in public that waterboarding was illegal torture, Schumer announced on November 2 that he would vote to confirm Mukasey.[113] He said Mukasey had assured him in a private meeting that he would enforce any law declaring waterboarding illegal, and that Mukasey had told him Bush would have ""no legal authority"" to ignore such a law.[114]

Cannabis

Schumer speaking at the NYC Cannabis Parade & Rally in 2022

In April 2018, Schumer said that he would back efforts to decriminalize cannabis at the federal level.[115] On April 20, a day known as 4/20, he announced his sponsorship of legislation to remove cannabis from the Controlled Substances Act. The bill would also provide funding for women and minority-owned businesses and for research into the public health effects of cannabis.[116] On June 27, 2018, Schumer formally introduced the Marijuana Freedom and Opportunity Act.[117]

On July 14, 2021, Schumer, along with senators Ron Wyden and Cory Booker, released for public comment a comprehensive federal legalization bill known as the Cannabis Administration and Opportunity Act.[118][119] On July 21, 2022, he formally introduced the bill.[120]

Clinton impeachment

Schumer voted on the impeachment charges of President Bill Clinton in both houses of Congress. Schumer was a member of the House of Representatives (and Judiciary Committee member) during a December 1998 lame-duck session of Congress, voting ""no"" on all counts in committee and on the floor of the House. In January 1999, Schumer, as a newly elected member of the Senate, also voted ""not guilty"" on the two impeachment charges.[121]

Consumer issues

Schumer has given legislative attention to consumer issues. He passed legislation that required uniform disclosure information on the back of credit card applications, notifying prospective cardholders of annual fees and interest rates. This standardized information is now known as the ""Schumer box"". Schumer has also aggressively pushed to end the practice whereby customers can be charged two ATM fees, one by their own bank and one by the bank that owns the ATM, if the ATM is outside their bank's network.[122]

With Representative Nita Lowey, Schumer has been working to ban the chemical bisphenol A (BPA), often found in baby bottles and plastic children's food containers.[123] The Canadian government has already banned BPA in baby bottles and children's products.[124] Schumer is also seeking a ban on the use of cadmium, a carcinogen known to impair brain development in children, in toys and children's jewelry.[125] When companies began selling gloves, pills, inhalers, diuretics, shampoos and other products during the 2009 swine flu scare, Schumer urged the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to open an investigation. In the end, the FTC put ten companies on notice and identified a total of 140 scams.[126]

Schumer has championed college tuition tax credits, calling for and passing a $4,000 tuition tax credit for students as part of a host of tax credits and cuts passed to stimulate the economy in the 2009 American Reinvestment and Recovery Act.[127]

Schumer received an ""A"" grade on the 2008 Drum Major Institute's Congressional Scorecard on middle-class issues.[128]

In October 2013, Schumer announced his support for a proposal ending restrictions on shipping beer, wine, and spirits through the U.S. Postal Service, saying it would ""help keep local post offices open by bringing in an estimated $225 million in new revenues to the USPS"" and broaden the availability of beers and wines to consumers.[129]

Death penalty

In 2013, Schumer said the death penalty would be ""appropriate"" in the case of Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, the perpetrator of the Boston Marathon bombing. ""The federal law allows the death penalty. ... I wrote the law in 1994 when I was head of the crime subcommittee in the House. This is just the kind of case that it should be applied to.""[130][131]

Disaster relief

In 2014, Schumer was recognized for helping to achieve the award of $700,000 in compensation from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) for Gowanda, New York, as a result of the devastating flood there in 2009.[132][133] A flash flood devastated the village, causing two deaths. Four feet of flood waters swept through the village, and caused much damage.[132][133] Gowanda was declared both a state and federal disaster site.[132][133]

Of the anticipated disbursement of FEMA monies to Gowanda, Schumer said:

FEMA and the state were sitting on Gowanda's money for way too long. It's about time that they made the village of Gowanda whole for the damage done in this flood. I've been advocating for this for months and months and months; I'm glad everyone came together and finally did the right thing.[132][133]

Donald Trump

Schumer attended the congressional leadership meeting with Trump in the White House Situation Room on January 2, 2019.

In a November 2016 interview conducted in the weeks after Trump's election to the presidency, Schumer said that he and Trump were not friends and had had ""civil conversations a couple of times"" when Trump had contacted him. Trump had said earlier that year that he believed he would get along with Schumer and that he was ""close to Schumer in many ways"".[134] In December 2016, Schumer called on Trump cabinet nominees to release their tax returns and in doing so follow the precedent set by Steve Mnuchin and Tom Price.[135]

In February 2017, before Trump's speech to a joint session of Congress, Schumer predicted that the speech would be less memorable than ones delivered by Trump's predecessors due to what he called ""a yawning gap between what he says and what his administration actually does for working Americans"". Though acknowledging Trump's populist campaigning style, Schumer said Trump ""governs like a pro-corporate, pro-elite, hard-right ideologue"".[136]

In March 2017, Schumer released a statement calling on Trump to apologize for claiming the Obama administration had wiretapped him during his presidential campaign. He advocated that Trump stop tweeting to better focus on working on behalf of the United States and said Trump had ""severely damaged his credibility"" by promoting conspiracy theories.[137]

In June 2018, Schumer delivered a Senate floor speech decrying Representative Maxine Waters's call to harass members of the Trump administration as protest of the administration's policies: ""I strongly disagree with those who advocate harassing folks if they don't agree with you. If you disagree with a politician, organize your fellow citizens to action and vote them out of office. But no one should call for the harassment of political opponents. That's not right. That's not American.""[138]

In August 2018, in response to Trump's charge that American Jews who vote for Democrats are ""disloyal"", Schumer tweeted, ""When he [Trump] uses a trope that's been used against the Jewish people for centuries with dire consequences, he is encouraging—wittingly or unwittingly—anti-Semites throughout the country and world.""[139]

Schumer was participating in the certification of the 2021 United States Electoral College vote count on January 6, 2021, when Trump supporters attacked the U.S. Capitol. Schumer and other members of Congress were removed from the Senate chambers. He and Mitch McConnell joined Nancy Pelosi and Steny Hoyer in an undisclosed location. As the attack persisted, Schumer and Pelosi released a joint statement calling on Trump to demand the rioters leave the Capitol and its grounds immediately.[140] When the Senate reconvened after the Capitol was secure, Schumer gave remarks, calling it a day ""that will live forever in infamy"".[141] Later that day, he blamed Trump for the attack, calling on Vice President Mike Pence to invoke the Twenty-fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution to remove Trump from office. He also said he would support impeachment.[142]

Election reform

In March 2002, as the Senate worked on a compromise to save an election reform bill that stalled due to Republicans' believing it was not combative enough against voter fraud, Schumer and Senator Ron Wyden led a successful effort in protecting an amendment allowing first-time voters to be verified with only a signature.[143]

Equal pay

In April 2014, the United States Senate debated the Paycheck Fairness Act (S. 2199; 113th Congress), a bill aimed at addressing the gender pay gap in the United States.[144] Republicans argued that the Democrats were attempting to use the votes on this bill and the issue of equal pay as political issues in the 2014 midterm elections.[144] Schumer backed the measure and told reporters, ""pay equity, that's women, that's 53 percent of the vote"".[144]

Financial industry regulation

In 1987, then-Representative Schumer wrote a New York Times op-ed opposing repeal of the Glass–Steagall Act of 1933, titled ""Don't Let Banks Become Casinos"".[145] In 1999, Schumer supported Congress's repeal of Glass–Steagall, saying: ""There are many reasons for this bill, but first and foremost is to ensure that U.S. financial firms remain competitive.""[146] Since 2010, the securities and investment industry has been the largest donor to Schumer's senatorial campaigns.[147]

According to a December 14, 2008, New York Times article on Schumer's role in the Wall Street meltdown, he embraced the industry's free-market, deregulatory agenda more than any other Democrat in Congress, backing measures blamed for contributing to the financial crisis. A review of his record showed that he took steps to protect the industry from government oversight and tougher rules. Over the years, he helped save financial institutions billions of dollars in taxes or fees. The article claimed that Schumer succeeded in limiting efforts to reform and regulate credit-rating agencies the George W. Bush administration and the SEC had proposed.[148]

The Charles Schumer-Rob Portman Senate bill of 2015[149] proposed to tax the $2.2 trillion multinational corporations are holding outside the country in tax-haven subsidiaries, on which 35% was already owed, as a one-time tax ""at a rate significantly lower than the statutory corporate rate"".[150]

In his book released in March 2010, No One Would Listen, Bernie Madoff whistleblower Harry Markopolos passed along an unsourced claim that Schumer called the SEC for information about the Madoff investigation. Schumer denied this.[151]

In response to The American Prospect's Day One Agenda,[152] Schumer announced a new stance on eliminating student debt. In November 2020, he said, ""I have a proposal with Elizabeth Warren that the first $50,000 of debt be vanquished, and we believe that Joe Biden can do that with the pen as opposed to legislation"".[153]

Foreign policy

In 2009, Schumer criticized Scotland's release of convicted Pan Am Flight 103 bomber Abdelbaset al-Megrahi and called for the United States to impose economic sanctions on the United Kingdom if Megrahi's release was tied to a massive oil deal between the United Kingdom and Libya.[154]

In April 2017, after the Shayrat missile strike, Schumer said a ""pinpointed, limited action to punish and hopefully deter Assad from doing this again is appropriate"" while warning against the United States becoming further involved in Syria.[155]

In July 2017, Schumer voted for the Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act, which grouped together sanctions against Iran, Russia, and North Korea.[156]

In July 2018, after Trump criticized Germany's decision to approve a new Russian-German gas pipeline under the Baltic Sea bypassing Poland and Ukraine, Schumer and House Minority Leader Pelosi released a joint statement condemning Trump's comments as an embarrassment and his behavior as ""another profoundly disturbing signal that the President is more loyal to President Putin than to our NATO allies"".[157]

In October 2020, Schumer called on the Trump administration to immediately suspend U.S. military aid to Azerbaijan,[158][159] sent through the Pentagon's ""building partner assistance program"".[159][160] According to critics, the aid could be used in the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict between Azerbaijan and Armenia.[159][161] He co-signed a letter stating:

We have been very critical of U.S. security assistance to Azerbaijan given the country's human rights record and aggression in the region. Earlier this year, at Senator Menendez's request, the Government Accountability Office agreed to conduct a review of security assistance to the country to ensure that it aligns with U.S. interests; this violence indicates that it does not.[159]

Afghanistan

In March 2006, the House Appropriations Committee voted to block an amendment allowing Dubai Ports World to operate some terminals at U.S. ports, an amendment that was inserted into the emergency supplemental funding bill for military actions in Iraq and Afghanistan. The same day, Schumer introduced an amendment barring a company from operating in a U.S. port if the company was owned by a country that recognized the Taliban's regime in Afghanistan, the amendment being touted as similar to the House measure. Senate majority leader Bill Frist subsequently asked for a quorum call that effectively gnarled proceedings, Schumer afterward opining that the Democrats had ""bent over backwards to try and accommodate the Republican schedule"" and that Frist's move meant Republicans did not want a vote at all.[162]

In October 2009, Schumer said, ""It cost us $6 trillion and 4,500 lives, approximately, to bring stability to Iraq. Just in terms of the loss of life and treasure, do we want to do the same exercise in Afghanistan?"" He said the United States could potentially be able to keep itself safe without bringing stability to Afghanistan and advocated that American forces be scaled back in Afghanistan in favor of more reliance on unmanned drone attacks.[163]

In April 2017, Schumer called for caution in Afghanistan, noting the casualties in Iraq, and said the military would have to come to Congress if it wanted more American soldiers in Afghanistan.[164]

China

In 2006, NPR reported that Schumer and Senator Lindsey Graham were highly critical of the trade imbalance between the U.S. and China, and its alleged cause of Chinese currency intervention.[165]

In 2017, Schumer wrote to Trump advocating for a block on China that would prevent it from purchasing more American companies to increase pressure on Beijing to help rein in North Korea's nuclear missile program.[166] In May 2018, after Trump signaled his willingness to ease sanctions on ZTE in a bid for a trade deal with Beijing, Schumer observed, ""This seems to be an area where Democrats and Republicans in the House and the Senate are coming together and telling the president, you've got to be tough on China, you have to have your actions match your rhetoric.""[167]

Before the Trump administration took concrete measures against China in late March 2018, Schumer and other Democratic leaders pressed Trump to focus more on China. Schumer said, ""China has stolen millions of jobs and trillions of dollars [but] administrations from both parties haven't been strong enough to fight back.""[168][169][170]

In October 2023, Schumer led a bipartisan congressional delegation's visit to China that included a meeting with Chinese president Xi Jinping. In a press conference, Schumer said the two sides spoke about their ""respective priorities"" and that he told Xi that ""America wants fairness and stability. At the foundation of the relationship must be a level playing field for American businesses and workers, as well as responsible competition"". The delegation also met Foreign Minister Wang Yi, National People's Congress Standing Committee Chairman Zhao Leji, and Shanghai Communist Party Secretary Chen Jining.[171]

Iran nuclear deal

On August 6, 2015, Schumer announced his opposition to the nuclear deal with Iran.[172] He planned to tell the White House, then his Senate colleagues, and then the public, but the White House leaked the news during the Republican debate in what CBS News described as an ""apparent attempt to limit coverage"".[173] Arms control expert Jeffrey Lewis derided Schumer's decision, noting that Schumer was making factually incorrect claims about the amount of time in which the treaty would allow inspection of Iranian nuclear facilities.[174] In what The Guardian described as a ""shot across Schumer's bow"", White House press secretary Josh Earnest said that fellow Democrats might remember Schumer's decision when deciding whom to elect as their next majority leader.[175]

Iraq

Schumer was a supporter of the Iraq War Resolution but was very critical of President George W. Bush's strategy in the Iraq War; he suggested that a commission of ex-generals be appointed to review it.[176]

In April 2002, during a Senate speech, Schumer called the Bush administration's Middle East policy ""muddled, confused and inconsistent"" and said the planned meeting between Secretary of State Colin Powell and Yasser Arafat would contradict Bush's stated stand against terrorists and those harboring them.[177] Nat Hentoff of the Village Voice wrote in November 2006 that ""the loquacious Schumer has been indifferent to the administration's war on the Constitution and on our laws and treaties"", particularly on the issue of torture.[178]

In July 2006, Prime Minister of Iraq Nouri al-Maliki stated that Iraq was urging the international community ""to take a quick and firm stance to stop this aggression against Lebanon, to stop the killing of innocent people and to stop the destruction of infrastructure"". In response, Schumer, Harry Reid, and Dick Durbin signed a letter to al-Maliki in which they charged him with failing to condemn the aggression of Hezbollah as well as Israel's right to defend itself, arguing the oversight raised serious concern about whether Iraq under his rule could ""play a constructive role in resolving the current crisis and bringing stability to the Middle East"".[179]

Schumer was the first senator to call for U.S. support for Kurdish independence after the 2017 Kurdistan Region independence referendum, releasing a resolution calling for the U.S. government to change its policy to ""support a political process that addresses the aspirations of the Kurds for an independent state"". He called upon Iraq to ""engage in a dialogue and peacefully determine the best way to accommodate the well-deserved and legitimate aspirations of the Iraqi Kurds"".[180]

Israel

In 1994, Schumer joined the Anti-Defamation League and the American Jewish Congress in a campaign to get the IRS to revoke the tax-exempt status of the Palestinian-American charity the Holy Land Foundation, which by the time it was shut down in 2001 was the country's largest Muslim charity.[181]

In June 2010, while speaking at an Orthodox Union event in Washington D.C., Schumer made comments about Israel's blockade of the Gaza Strip that were later criticized.[182] He pointed to statistics to show that the Palestinian citizens of the West Bank were experiencing ""economic prosperity"", crediting this to their government's cooperation with the Israeli government on combating terrorists.[183] He then criticized the Palestinian citizens of the Gaza Strip for voting for the Hamas militant organization, calling on Israel to ""strangle them economically until they see that's not the way to go"", while also stating that Israel should continue providing ""humanitarian aid"" to Palestinian civilians. He argued that the Israeli blockade of the Gaza Strip is justified not only because it keeps weapons out of the Palestinian territory, but also because it shows Palestinians living there that ""when there's some moderation and cooperation, they can have an economic advancement.""[182][184] Schumer added, ""The Palestinian people still don't believe in a Jewish state, in a two-state solution. More do than before, but a majority still do not ... They don't believe in the Torah. They don't believe in King David. So they don't think it's our land"".[183]

Schumer supported Israel in the 2014 Israel–Gaza conflict.[185] In March 2018, he told AIPAC's delegates that Israeli settlements in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, including East Jerusalem, have nothing to do with the Israeli–Palestinian conflict.[186][187]

Schumer is a co-sponsor of a Senate resolution expressing objection to the UN Security Council Resolution 2334, which condemned Israeli settlement-building in the occupied Palestinian territories as a violation of international law. He criticized Obama, saying: ""past administrations—both Democrat and Republican—have protected Israel from the vagaries of this biased institution [the U.N.]. Unfortunately, by abstaining on United Nations Resolution 2334, this administration has not followed in that path.""[188]

Schumer and Israeli president Isaac Herzog in Tel Aviv during the Israel–Hamas war on October 15, 2023

In May 2017, Schumer co-sponsored the Israel Anti-Boycott Act, Senate Bill 720, which made it a federal crime, punishable by a maximum sentence of 20 years imprisonment,[189] for Americans to encourage or participate in boycotts against Israel and Israeli settlements in the occupied Palestinian territories if protesting actions by the Israeli government. The bill would make it legal for U.S. states to refuse to do business with contractors that engage in boycotts against Israel.[190]

Schumer introduced a Senate resolution celebrating the 50th anniversary of the reunification of Jerusalem.[191]

In May 2018, Schumer praised Trump for opening the U.S. embassy in Jerusalem, saying, ""I sponsored legislation to do this two decades ago, and I applaud President Trump for doing it.""[192][193] He had previously accused Trump of ""indecisiveness"" for his delays in implementing the move by waiving the Jerusalem Embassy Act of 1995, as previous presidents had done.[194]

In a March 14, 2024, Senate speech, Schumer said Israeli prime minister Netanyahu was an impediment to peace in the Middle East and called for elections to replace him when the Israel–Hamas war abated. Schumer said the many civilian deaths in Gaza was causing international support for Israel to fall to historic lows.[195][196] Netanyahu responded by arranging to address a Senate GOP conference by video.[197]

North Korea

In February 2017, Schumer said that North Korea had proved itself to be ""an irresponsible nation in every way"" and that China could be used to curtail North Korea as most of North Korea's imports and exports go through China. He advocated that the United States tell China ""they have to put the wood to North Korea in a much more serious way than they have done so far.""[198] In August, after Trump said North Korea would be ""met with fire and fury like the world has never seen"" in the event of continued threats against the United States, Schumer released a statement advocating that the United States be ""firm and deliberate with North Korea, but reckless rhetoric is not a strategy to keep America safe.""[199]

In May 2018, Schumer called for Kim Jong-un to be removed from the commemorative coin memorializing the 2018 North Korea–United States summit, calling Kim a ""brutal dictator"" and offering the Peace House as a more appropriate alternative.[200] In June, Schumer was one of seven senior Democratic senators to sign a letter to Trump outlining the conditions of their caucus's support for any deal resulting from the North Korea-US summit.[201] After Kim and Trump issued a joint statement, Schumer said the meeting between the two had given ""a brutal and repressive dictatorship the international legitimacy it has long craved"" and that the agreement lacked details on achieving a pathway to the Korean peninsula being denuclearized, how the United States would verify North Korea's disarming, and an assurance of cessation for enrichment of plutonium and uranium from North Korea.[202] In a speech on the Senate floor, Schumer questioned what the United States had gained from the summit and added that the country had ""won far stronger language on denuclearization"" in previous agreements with North Korea. In response, Trump tweeted,

Thank you Chuck, but are you sure you got that right? No more nuclear testing or rockets flying all over the place, blew up launch sites. Hostages already back, hero remains coming home & much more![203]

Russia

In a June 3, 2008, Wall Street Journal op-ed, Schumer wrote that cooperative economic sanctions from the U.S., Britain, France, Germany, Russia and China could topple Iran's theocratic government. In discussing the importance of Russia's cooperation, Schumer wrote, ""Mr. Putin is an old-fashioned nationalist who seeks to regain the power and greatness Russia had before the fall of the Soviet Union."" He added, ""The anti-missile system strengthens the relationship between Eastern Europe and NATO, with real troops and equipment on the ground. It mocks Mr. Putin's dream of eventually restoring Russian hegemony over Eastern Europe.""[204] On June 10, the East European Coalition sent Schumer a letter about his article, writing, ""As a supporter of democracy for the nations of Eastern Europe, which suffered greatly under 'Russian hegemony over Eastern Europe', your suggestion that these nations be used as bargaining chips in order to appease Russia is troubling, inexplicable and unacceptable.""[205]

In August 2013, after Russia granted asylum to Edward Snowden, Schumer said Putin was behaving like a ""schoolyard bully"", adding, ""The relationship between the United States and Russia is more poisonous than any time since the Cold War because of all of this.""[206]

In December 2016, Schumer joined John McCain, Lindsey Graham, and Jack Reed in a letter to Majority Leader McConnell urging the formation of a Senate select committee on cyber. Schumer said the panel would focus on Russian meddling and potential threats from other countries such as China and Iran.[207]

In December 2016, Schumer demanded a congressional inquiry into Russian meddling in U.S. affairs.[208] In January 2017, in response to those questioning the U.S. intelligence community over its assessments, he said, ""Let me tell you, you take on the intelligence community, they have six ways from Sunday at getting back at you"".[209] Later that month, he introduced legislation to limit executive action on Russian sanctions.[210]

In a May 2017 Senate floor speech, Schumer called on the White House to release unedited transcripts of the meeting between Trump and Russian officials the previous week, saying the continued confidentiality would ensure ""the American people will rightly doubt if their president can handle our nation's most closely kept secrets.""[211] In July, Schumer disavowed claims that the Democratic Party considered Russia its top priority and named health care and economic stability for working-class families as its primary concerns. ""Obviously Russia is in the news. Obviously we want Bob Mueller to be able to pursue and our committees to be able to pursue their investigations unimpeded.""[212]

Schumer spearheaded a non-binding resolution in July 2018 ""warning President Trump not to let the Russian government question diplomats and other officials"". The resolution stated the United States ""should refuse to make available any current or former diplomat, civil servant, political appointee, law enforcement official or member of the Armed Forces of the United States for questioning by the government of Vladimir Putin"". It passed 98–0.[213]

Gun laws

In 1994, then-representative Schumer and Senator Dianne Feinstein authored the Assault Weapons Ban. Supporters of gun control legislation give Schumer much of the credit for passage of both the Assault Weapons Ban and the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act.[214] The Assault Weapons Ban, which banned semi-automatic rifles, shotguns, and handguns with certain features, expired in September 2004 despite attempts by Schumer to extend it. He was one of 16 senators to vote against the Vitter Amendment, which prohibited the confiscation of legally owned firearms during a disaster.[215]

While a target of gun rights organizations, Schumer has supported hunters, sponsoring legislation to provide millions in outdoor recreation grants to landowners who allow hunting and fishing on their private property. For these efforts, Field and Stream magazine honored Schumer in its ""Hero Awards"" in 2008.[216] He supports tax deductions for hunters who donate venison and other game to feeding programs.[217] In response to a question at a debate during his 2010 reelection campaign, Schumer denied having a handgun or a permit for one. He has produced a letter from the NYPD stating that neither he nor his wife, Iris Weinshall, has a handgun license from NYC. Schumer aide Brian Fallon said, ""except for winning an NRA marksmanship award at age 14, the senator does not own a gun or have a license to carry one"".[218]

In February 2018, after the Stoneman Douglas High School shooting, Schumer was one of four Democratic senators to sign a letter to Trump asserting that were he ""to endorse legislation to require a background check on every gun purchase, without other poison pill provisions attached, we could finally move much closer towards the comprehensive system that you called for after the Stoneman Douglas attack"" and that there was no justification for allowing people denied firearms by federally licensed dealers to ""simply visit a gun show or go online to purchase the same gun that they were denied at the store"".[219]

In January 2019, Schumer was one of 40 senators to introduce the Background Check Expansion Act, which would require background checks for either the sale or transfer of all firearms including all unlicensed sellers. Exceptions to the bill's background check requirement included transfers between members of law enforcement, loaning firearms for either hunting or sporting events on a temporary basis, providing firearms as gifts to members of one's immediate family, firearms transferred as part of an inheritance, or giving a firearm to another person temporarily for immediate self-defense.[220]

Health care

In March 2004, Schumer, Jon Corzine, Ted Kennedy, and Frank Lautenberg signed a letter to President Bush urging him to instruct staff to avoid taking action against whistleblower Richard Foster after Foster spoke out on the subject of White House efforts intended to keep Congress unaware of alternative higher cost estimates for the new Medicare prescription drug program.[221]

Schumer supported Obama's health reform legislation; he voted for the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act in December 2009[222] and for the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010.[223]

In 2009, Schumer proposed that any new government-run health insurance programs follow all the standards applicable to private insurance. He did this to ""address fears that a public program would drive private insurers from the market"". Schumer said he wanted ""a level playing field for competition"".[224]

In May 2017, in response to an amendment by Fred Upton to the American Health Care Act, Schumer released a statement saying the amendment ""leaves Americans with pre-existing conditions as vulnerable as they were before under this bill"" and compared it to ""administering cough medicine to someone with stage 4 cancer"".[225] After the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) showed the American Health Care Act would cause millions of Americans to lose health coverage, Schumer said, ""Republicans in Washington and the president should read this report cover to cover, throw their bill in the trash can and begin working with Democrats on a real plan to lower costs for the American people.""[226] In June, Schumer sent McConnell a letter requesting that all senators meet to discuss the American Health Care Act, citing the need for both parties to ""come together to find solutions to America's challenges"".[227] Later that month, Schumer estimated the bill had a 50% chance of passing the Senate and added that Democrats were doing everything they could to fight the measure, calling the legislation ""devastating for the middle class"".[228]

Homeland security

In 1995, Schumer sponsored the Omnibus Counterterrorism Act of 1995 (H.R. 896) in the House of Representatives.[229]

As a senator, Schumer has worked to secure homeland security funds for the New York State and New York City and provide resources to its first responders. He delivered over $20 billion to support New York's security and recovery efforts after the 9/11 terrorist attacks on New York City and worked to deliver $200 million in Homeland Security funds to protect New York City mass transit.[230][231][232]

In November 2001, Schumer announced hearings on George W. Bush's decision to try terrorists in military tribunals amid Washington concerns that Bush would skip the American legal system in handling such cases. Schumer said the hearing's two goals were to ascertain whether Bush had the power to form a tribunal apart from an attempt at interacting with Congress and whether a military tribunal was the most efficient instrument.[233]

In August 2004, after American officials leaked the arrest of Muhammad Naeem Noor Khan to reporters, Schumer said he was troubled by the decision to reveal Khan's identity, citing the fact that the public had learned little of Khan's role in providing the information that led Homeland Security Secretary Tom Ridge to announce a higher terror alert level.[234]

Schumer supported continuing to fully fund the FIRE Grant program[235] the Federal Emergency Management Agency administered. The program allows fire departments and first responders nationwide to apply for grant funding for major purchases that localities have difficulty providing, namely apparatus and emergency vehicles. When the Bush administration pushed a plan to reduce the program from $1 billion to just under $300 million, Schumer helped lead an effort with local firefighters to block the cuts.[236]

In March 2018, Schumer said the bipartisan legislation sponsored by Bob Casey and Pat Toomey would assist the children of deceased first respondents afford college by increasing the availability of Pell grant funding.[237]

In August 2018, Schumer announced that the Senate had passed $1 million in FY2019 funding for the national firefighter cancer registry as an amendment to the upcoming FY2019 Health and Human Services minibus appropriations bill. He said firefighters needed ""first-rate medical care and treatment"" for the work they did and the registry would help ""researchers track, treat, and eventually prevent firefighters being stricken by cancer"".[238]

Immigration

While discussing an immigration bill on the Senate floor in 2010, Schumer likened Indian tech giant Infosys Technologies to a ""chop shop"". When his statement set off a wave of outrage in India, he acknowledged his characterization was incorrect.[239][240] The remark was also called ""outrageous"" by U.S.-India Business Council head Ron Somers.[240]

Schumer is one of the Gang of Eight, a bipartisan group of four Democratic and four Republican senators who wrote and sponsored a 2013 comprehensive immigration reform bill. At the time, Schumer was the chairman of the Immigration, Refugees, and Border Security subcommittee of the Senate Judiciary Committee.[241] In June 2013, the immigration bill passed the Senate with a strong majority—68-32, with 14 Republicans joining all Democrats—but the House of Representatives under Speaker John Boehner refused to take up the bill, and the legislation died.[242]

In April 2012, Schumer introduced SB 1070, a bill that would kill Arizona's anti-immigration law, and ones like it if the Supreme Court ruled in favor of the states. He backed his position, saying: ""States like Arizona and Alabama will no longer be able to get away with saying they are simply 'helping the federal government' to enforce the law when they are really writing their own laws and knowingly deploying untrained officers with a mission of arresting anyone and everyone who might fit the preconceived profile of an illegal immigrant.""[243]

In January 2018, Schumer stated that any agreement on the status of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals before its March expiration would have to be included in the spending bill.[244] Schumer offered Trump congressional approval of more than $20 billion for his border wall in exchange for protecting recipients of DACA. Trump declined the offer. A week later, Schumer announced that conversations on immigration and border security were resuming between the White House and himself.[245] In a March CNN op-ed, Schumer wrote that Trump had stood in the way of progress on ""compromise proposals that both sides should be proud of"" and charged Trump and the White House with using Dreamers as ""bargaining chips to push forward their anti-immigrant agenda"". He called on Trump to change course and said Americans would be aware that he was behind the prevention of Congress from settling the matter.[246] In June, before a planned meeting between Trump and House Republicans for discussions on the compromise immigration bill, Schumer warned that House moderates would lose credibility if they succumbed to pressure and enacted ""the hard right's agenda"".[247]

IndyMac Bank controversy

On June 26, 2008, Schumer took the extraordinary step of publicly releasing letters he had written to regulators about IndyMac Bank, the country's seventh-largest savings and loan association and ninth-largest originator of mortgage loans, which he considered a severely troubled institution. Schumer wrote that he was ""concerned that IndyMac's financial deterioration poses significant risks to both taxpayers and borrowers and that the regulatory community may not be prepared to take measures that would help prevent the collapse of IndyMac."" Many IndyMac depositors either panicked or, from another perspective, justifiably acted and withdrew funds in the 11 days before IndyMac failed.[248]

A Treasury Department's inspector general audit found that the primary causes of IndyMac's failure were associated with its business strategy of originating and securitizing Alt-A loans on a large scale. When home prices declined in the latter half of 2007 and the secondary mortgage market collapsed, IndyMac was forced to hold $10.7 billion of loans it could not sell in the secondary market. IndyMac's reduced liquidity was further exacerbated when account holders withdrew $1.55 billion in deposits in a ""run"" on the thrift after the public release of Schumer's letter. While the run was a contributing factor in the timing of IndyMac's demise, the underlying cause of the failure was the unsafe and unsound manner in which the thrift was operated.[249]

Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS) director John Reich immediately blamed IndyMac's failure on the letter's release. Reich said Schumer gave the bank a ""heart attack"", saying, ""Would the institution have failed without the deposit run? We'll never know the answer to that question.""[250] Reich and top deputies later resigned or were removed amid a Treasury Department audit and investigation revealing that Indymac had been allowed to backdate its financial reports.[251]

Schumer conceded his actions might have caused some depositors to withdraw their money prematurely, but said, ""if OTS had done its job as regulator and not let IndyMac's poor and loose lending practices continue, we wouldn't be where we are today. Instead of pointing false fingers of blame, OTS should start doing its job to prevent future IndyMacs."" He added, ""IndyMac was one of the most poorly run and reckless of all the banks ... It was a spinoff from the old Countrywide, and like Countrywide, it did all kinds of profligate activities that it never should have. Both IndyMac and Countrywide helped cause the housing crisis we're now in.""[252][253]

Despite IndyMac's condition before the failure, the financial media sharply criticized Schumer. CNBC financial analyst Jerry Bowyer charged that he was responsible for the ""second largest bank failure in US history"".[254] While opining that IndyMac's failure was only a matter of time, banking consultant Bert Ely called Schumer's actions ""wrong and irresponsible"".[255]

On October 18, 2008, The Wall Street Journal published an article suggesting that an investment company's interest in IndyMac might have prompted Schumer's letter.[256] His reported close ties to the founders of OneWest Bank have long been of interest to many action groups. On December 22, 2008, The Washington Post reported that the OTS regional director in charge had been removed from his position for allowing IndyMac to falsify its financial reporting.[257][258] The same day, conservative commentator Rush Limbaugh continued to blame Schumer and recast IndyMac's July bankruptcy as an ""October Surprise"" planned by Democrats to help win the 2008 election.[259]

Same-sex marriage

Schumer voted for the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) in 1996.[260] He opposed the Federal Marriage Amendment, saying in 2004 that DOMA made it obsolete.[261]

In March 2009, Schumer announced his support for same-sex marriage, noting that it ""was time"".[262] He previously supported civil unions. At a private dinner with gay leaders on March 22, 2009, Schumer said he not only supported same-sex marriage, he also backed a full reversal of DOMA.[263] When the New York State Senate took up a bill to legalize gay marriage in December 2009, Schumer and other statewide officials aggressively lobbied wavering senators to support the legislation.[264]

Student loan forgiveness

Schumer supports the cancellation of $50,000 or more in federal student loan debt for every borrower by executive action.[265]

Subprime mortgage and foreclosure crisis

In September 2007, Schumer proposed that the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight (OFHEO) raise Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac's conforming loan (""affordable"") limits from $417,000 to $625,000, thereby allowing these government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs) to back mortgages on homes priced up to $780,000 with a 20% down payment.[266]

After the March 2007 meltdown of the subprime mortgage industry, Schumer proposed a federal government bailout of subprime borrowers to save homeowners from losing their residences and to shore up communities that were seeing neighborhoods destabilized due to foreclosures and the resulting decreases in neighboring home values.[267] As part of a package of regulatory reforms that Schumer pushed in response to the subprime foreclosure crisis, he called for the creation of mortgage industry regulators to protect borrowers from deceptive lending practices and called for the Securities and Exchange Commission to move from Washington to New York so that it was in closer proximity to the industry it was charged with overseeing.[268]

Schumer's top nine campaign contributors are all financial institutions that have contributed over $2.5 million.[269]

Taxes on high incomes

Schumer had been a staunch defender of low taxes on hedge fund and private equity managers in the mid-2000s, arguing that this was necessary to protect the industry. Then serving on both the Senate Banking and Finance Committees, Schumer was in a position to block attempts to tax their financial gains at the rate other taxpayers pay for income.[270] But in 2010, he suggested that a hedge-fund tax would be acceptable and not hurt the industry.[271]

In February 2012, Schumer at first said he disagreed with the Obama administration's call to raise taxes on those making more than $250,000 a year, calling for a million-dollar floor instead. According to Schumer, ""in large parts of the country, that kind of income does not get you a big home or lots of vacations or anything else that is associated with wealth.""[272] He later stood by the assertion but also said that raising taxes on those making more than $250,000 was necessary to bring in enough revenue.[272]

Technology and the Internet

In June 2011, Schumer and Senator Joe Manchin sought a crackdown on Bitcoin, saying it facilitated illegal drug trade transactions. ""The transactions leave no traditional [bank transfer] money trail for investigators to follow, and leave it hard to prove a package recipient knew in advance what was in a shipment,"" which used the anonymizing network Tor.[273] One opinion website said the senators wanted ""to disrupt [the] Silk Road drug website"".[274]

Schumer is a sponsor of S. 968, the controversial PROTECT IP Act, which would restrict access to websites judged to be infringing copyrights.[275] On January 18, 2012, the NY Tech Meetup and other cybertech organizations held a demonstration with 2,000 protesters in front of the offices of Schumer and Kirsten Gillibrand, who also supported the bill.[276][277] Some demonstrators complained that the bill had originated with wealthy campaign contributors who would reward legislators for passing the bill.[278]

In March 2012, Schumer and Senator Richard Blumenthal gained national attention after they called upon Attorney General Eric Holder and the Department of Justice to investigate practices by employers to require Facebook passwords for employee applicants and workers.[279]

Facebook

Schumer has offered political support to Facebook, acting as an ally and seeking to advance the company's interests in Senate debates about regulating it or probing its involvement in various controversies, including Russian interference in the 2016 election.[280] In July 2018, he confronted Senator Mark Warner, and urged him not to lose sight of the need for Facebook to tackle problems with right-wing disinformation and election interference, as well as consumer privacy and other issues.[280] As of 2018, one of Schumer's daughters worked as a marketing manager at Facebook.[280]

U.S. attorney firings

As chair of the Subcommittee on Administrative Oversight and the Courts, Schumer took a lead role in the investigation of the dismissal of U.S. attorneys controversy.[281] Although he was at one point criticized for being a lead investigator of the affair while also chairing the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, such criticism was not sustained after the full dimensions of the controversy became apparent.[282][283]

On March 11, 2007, Schumer became the first lawmaker in either chamber to call for Attorney General Alberto Gonzales to resign for firing eight United States attorneys. In an interview on CBS News's Face the Nation, Schumer said that Gonzales ""doesn't accept or doesn't understand that he is no longer just the president's lawyer"".[284] When Gonzales's chief of staff, Kyle Sampson, resigned on March 13, Schumer said during a press conference that Gonzales was ""carrying out the political wishes of the president"" and declared that Sampson would ""not be the next Scooter Libby"", meaning that he did not accept that Sampson had sole responsibility for the controversy.[285]

Like other members of the Senate Judiciary Committee from both parties, Schumer was angered during Gonzales's testimony on April 19, 2007; Gonzales answered many times that he did not know or could not recall details about the controversy. When Schumer's turn came to ask his last round of questions, he instead repeated his call for Gonzales to resign, saying that there was no point to further questioning since Gonzales had ""answered 'I don't know' or 'I can't recall' to close to a hundred questions"" about the firings (most press reports counted 71 instances) and did not seem to know about the inner workings of his department. Gonzales responded that the onus was on the committee to prove whether anything improper occurred. Schumer replied that Gonzales faced a higher standard, and that under this standard he had to give ""a full, complete and convincing explanation"" for why the eight attorneys were fired.[286]

Other work

In January 2007, Schumer published a book, Positively American: Winning Back the Middle-Class Majority One Family at a Time, outlining strategies by which Democrats could court middle-class voters. One of his aides at the time, Daniel Squadron, helped write it, and they drew from Schumer's experience helping his party win in the 2006 midterm elections.[30][287]

On November 21, 2023, Schumer made his Broadway debut in a one-night performance as the Producer in Gutenberg! The Musical!.[288]

Personal life

Schumer and his wife, Iris Weinshall, were married on September 21, 1980. The ceremony took place at Windows on the World atop the north tower of the World Trade Center.[289] Weinshall was New York City's commissioner of transportation from 2000 to 2007.[290] Schumer and Weinshall live in Park Slope near Grand Army Plaza.[291]

The Schumers have two children, Jessica and Alison, both graduates of their father's alma mater, Harvard College. Jessica served as chief of staff and general counsel of the Council of Economic Advisers from May 2013 to August 2015.[292] Alison is a marketing manager in Facebook's New York office.[293] In 2018, Jessica gave birth to a son, making Schumer a grandfather.[294]

Despite having grown up as a fan of the New York Giants,[295] Schumer has publicly expressed support for the Buffalo Bills.[296] After the Bills won the 2025 AFC East championship game, he said it was a ""great day to be a Buffalo Bills fan"" during remarks on the Senate floor.[297]

Bernard Sanders (born September 8, 1941) is an American politician and activist who is the senior United States senator from Vermont. He is the longest-serving independent in U.S. congressional history, but maintains a close relationship with the Democratic Party, having caucused with House and Senate Democrats for most of his congressional career and sought the party's presidential nomination in 2016 and 2020. Sanders has been viewed as the leader of the modern American progressive movement.[1][2][3]

Born into a working-class Jewish family and raised in the Brooklyn borough of New York City, Sanders attended Brooklyn College before graduating from the University of Chicago in 1964. While a student, he was a protest organizer for the Congress of Racial Equality (CORE) and the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) during the civil rights movement. After settling in Vermont in 1968, he ran unsuccessful third-party political campaigns in the early-to-mid-1970s. He was elected mayor of Burlington in 1981 as an independent and was reelected three times.

Sanders was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1990, representing Vermont's at-large congressional district. In 1991, he and five other House members co-founded the Congressional Progressive Caucus.[4] Sanders was a U.S. representative for 16 years before being elected to the U.S. Senate in 2006, becoming the first non-Republican elected to Vermont's Class 1 seat since Whig Solomon Foot in 1850. Sanders was reelected in 2012, 2018, and 2024. He chaired the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee from 2013 to 2015, the Senate Budget Committee from 2021 to 2023, and the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee from 2023 to 2025. He is the senior senator and dean of the Vermont congressional delegation.

Sanders was a major candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2016 and 2020, finishing in second place both times. Despite initially low expectations, his 2016 campaign generated significant grassroots enthusiasm and funding from small-dollar donors, helping him win 23 primaries and caucuses.[5] In 2020, his strong showing in early primaries and caucuses made him the front-runner in a historically large field of Democratic candidates. He came to be a close ally of Joe Biden after the 2020 primaries.[6][7] Following the loss of Democratic candidate Kamala Harris to Donald Trump in the 2024 election, Sanders has vocally opposed Trump's corruption and what he describes as a right-wing oligarchy.[8][9]

Sanders is credited with influencing a leftward shift in the Democratic Party after his 2016 presidential campaign. An advocate of progressive policies, he opposes neoliberalism and supports workers' self-management. He supports universal and single-payer healthcare, paid parental leave, tuition-free tertiary education, a Green New Deal, and worker control of production through cooperatives, unions, and democratic public enterprises. On foreign policy, he supports reducing military spending, pursuing more diplomacy and international cooperation, and greater emphasis on labor rights and environmental concerns in negotiating international trade agreements. Sanders supports workplace democracy and has praised elements of the Nordic model. Some have compared and contrasted his politics to left-wing populism and the New Deal policies of President Franklin D. Roosevelt.[10]

Early life

Sanders as a senior in high school, 1959

Bernard Sanders was born on September 8, 1941, in the Brooklyn borough of New York City.[11] His father, Elias Ben Yehuda Sanders (1904–1962),[12] a Polish-Jewish immigrant, was born in Słopnice, a town in Austrian Galicia that was then part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire and is now in Poland.[13][14] Elias Sanders immigrated to the United States in 1921[15] and became a paint salesman.[13][16] Bernie's mother, Dorothy Sanders (née Glassberg) (1912–1960), was born in New York City.[17][18] He is the younger brother of Larry Sanders.

Sanders says he became interested in politics at an early age due to his family background.[19] In the 1940s, many of his relatives in German-occupied Poland were murdered in the Holocaust.[12][15][18][20]

Sanders lived in Midwood, Brooklyn.[11] He attended elementary school at P.S. 197, where he won a borough championship on the basketball team.[21][22] He attended Hebrew school in the afternoons and celebrated his bar mitzvah in 1954.[23] His older brother Larry said that during their childhood, the family never lacked food or clothing, but major purchases, ""like curtains or a rug"", were not affordable.[24]

Sanders attended James Madison High School, where he was captain of the track team and took third place in the New York City indoor one-mile race.[21] In high school, he lost his first election, finishing last of three candidates for the student body presidency with a campaign that focused on aiding Korean War orphans. Despite the loss, he became active in his school's fundraising activities for Korean orphans, including organizing a charity basketball game.[25] Sanders attended high school with economist Walter Block.[26] When he was 19, his mother died at age 47.[18][23] His father died two years later, in 1962, at age 57.[14]

Sanders studied at Brooklyn College for a year in 1959–1960 before transferring to the University of Chicago and graduating with a Bachelor of Arts degree in political science in 1964.[27] In later interviews, Sanders described himself as a mediocre college student because the classroom was ""boring and irrelevant"" and said he viewed community activism as more important to his education.[28]

Early career

Political activism

Sanders later described his time in Chicago as ""the major period of intellectual ferment in my life.""[29] While there, he joined the Young People's Socialist League (the youth affiliate of the Socialist Party of America)[30] and was active in the civil rights movement as a student for the Congress of Racial Equality (CORE) and the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC).[18][31] Under his chairmanship, the university chapter of CORE merged with the university chapter of the SNCC.[32] In January 1962, he went to a rally at the University of Chicago administration building to protest university president George Wells Beadle's segregated campus housing policy. At the protest, Sanders said, ""We feel it is an intolerable situation when Negro and white students of the university cannot live together in university-owned apartments"". He and 32 other students then entered the building and camped outside the president's office.[33][34] After weeks of sit-ins, Beadle and the university formed a commission to investigate discrimination.[35] After further protests, the University of Chicago ended racial segregation in private university housing in the summer of 1963.[29]

Joan Mahoney, a member of the University of Chicago CORE chapter at the time and a fellow participant in the sit-ins, described Sanders in a 2016 interview as ""a swell guy, a nice Jewish boy from Brooklyn, but he wasn't terribly charismatic. One of his strengths, though, was his ability to work with a wide group of people, even those he didn't agree with.""[36] Sanders once spent a day putting up fliers protesting police brutality, only to notice later that Chicago police had shadowed him and taken them all down.[33] He attended the 1963 March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom, where Martin Luther King Jr. gave the ""I Have a Dream"" speech.[18][33][37] That summer, Sanders was fined $25 (equivalent to $257 in 2024) for resisting arrest during a demonstration in Englewood against segregation in Chicago's public schools.[29][38][39]

In addition to his civil rights activism during the 1960s and 1970s,[32] Sanders was active in several peace and antiwar movements while attending the University of Chicago, becoming a member of the Student Peace Union. He applied for conscientious objector status during the Vietnam War; his application was eventually turned down, by which point he was too old to be drafted. Although he opposed the war, Sanders never criticized those who fought in it and has strongly supported veterans' benefits throughout his political career.[40][41] He was briefly an organizer with the United Packinghouse Workers of America while in Chicago.[29] He also worked on the reelection campaign of Leon Despres, a prominent Chicago alderman who opposed then-mayor Richard J. Daley's Democratic Party machine. Sanders said that he spent much of his student years reading history, sociology, psychology, and the works of political authors, from Thomas Jefferson, Abraham Lincoln, John Dewey, Karl Marx, and Erich Fromm—""reading everything except what I was supposed to read for class the next day.""[6][42]

Professional history and early years in Vermont

After graduating from college, Sanders returned to New York City, where he worked various jobs, including Head Start teacher, psychiatric aide, and carpenter.[28] In 1968, he moved to Stannard, Vermont, a town small in both area and population (88 residents at the 1970 census) within Vermont's rural Northeast Kingdom region, because he had been ""captivated by rural life"". While there, he worked as a carpenter,[30] filmmaker, and writer[43] who created and sold ""radical film strips"" and other educational materials to schools.[44] He also wrote several articles for the alternative publication The Vermont Freeman.[45] He lived in the area for several years before moving to the more populous Chittenden County in the mid-1970s. During his 2018 reelection campaign, he returned to the town to hold an event with voters and other candidates.[46]

Liberty Union campaigns

From 1969 to 1971, Sanders resided in Montpelier.[47] After moving to Burlington,[48] he began his electoral political career as a member of the Liberty Union Party, a national umbrella party for various socialist-oriented state parties, originating in the anti-war movement and the People's Party. He ran as the Liberty Union candidate for governor of Vermont in 1972 and 1976 and as a candidate in the special election for U.S. senator in 1972 and in the general election in 1974.[49] In the 1974 senatorial race, he finished third (5,901 votes; 4%), behind 34-year-old Chittenden County state's attorney Patrick Leahy (D; 70,629 votes; 49%) and two-term incumbent U.S. Representative Dick Mallary (R; 66,223 votes; 46%).[50][51]

The 1976 campaign was the zenith of the Liberty Union's influence, with Sanders collecting 11,317 votes for governor and the party. His strong performance forced the down-ballot races for lieutenant governor and secretary of state to be decided by the state legislature when its vote total prevented either the Republican or Democratic candidate for those offices from garnering a majority of votes.[52] But the campaign drained the Liberty Union's finances and energy, and in October 1977, Sanders and the Liberty Union candidate for attorney general, Nancy Kaufman, announced their retirement from the party.[52][53] During the 1980 presidential election, Sanders was one of three electors for the Socialist Workers Party in Vermont.[54]

After resigning from the Liberty Union Party in 1977, Sanders worked as a writer and as the director of the nonprofit American People's Historical Society (APHS).[55] While with the APHS, he produced a 30-minute documentary about American labor leader Eugene V. Debs, who ran for president five times as the Socialist Party candidate.[30][56]

Mayor of Burlington, Vermont (1981–1989)

Burlington City Hall

Campaigns

On November 8, 1980, Sanders announced his candidacy for mayor. He formally announced his campaign on December 16 at a City Hall press conference.[57][58] Sanders selected Linda Niedweske as his campaign manager.[59] The Citizens Party attempted to nominate Greg Guma for mayor, but Guma declined, saying it would be ""difficult to run against another progressive candidate"".[60] Sanders had been convinced to run for the mayoralty by his close friend Richard Sugarman, an Orthodox Jewish professor of religious studies at the University of Vermont, who had shown him a ward-by-ward breakdown of the 1976 Vermont gubernatorial election, in which Sanders had run, that showed him receiving 12% of the vote in Burlington despite only getting 6% statewide.[61]

Sanders initially won the mayoral election by 22 votes against incumbent mayor Gordon Paquette, Richard Bove, and Joseph McGrath, but the margin was later reduced to 10 votes. Paquette did not contest the results of the recount.[62]

Paquette's loss was attributed to his own shortcomings, as he did not campaign or promote his candidacy since neither Sanders nor Bove was seen as a serious challenger. Sanders had not previously won an election.[63] Paquette was also considered to have lost because he proposed an unpopular $0.65 per $100 raise in taxes that Sanders opposed.[64] Sanders spent around $4,000 on his campaign.[65]

Sanders castigated the pro-development incumbent as an ally of prominent shopping center developer Antonio Pomerleau, while Paquette warned of ruin for Burlington if Sanders were elected. The Sanders campaign was bolstered by a wave of optimistic volunteers as well as a series of endorsements from university professors, social welfare agencies, and the police union. The result shocked the local political establishment.[52]

Sanders formed a coalition between independents and the Citizens Party.[66] On December 3, 1982, he announced that he would seek reelection.[67] On January 22, 1983, the Citizens Party voted unanimously to endorse Sanders, although Sanders ran as an independent.[68] He was reelected, defeating Judy Stephany and James Gilson.[69]

Sanders initially considered not seeking a third term but announced on December 5, 1984, that he would run.[70] He formally launched his campaign on December 7 and was reelected.[71][72] On December 1, 1986, Sanders, who had finished third in the 1986 Vermont gubernatorial election, announced that he would seek reelection to a fourth term as mayor of Burlington, despite close associates saying that he was tired of being mayor.[73] Sanders defeated Democratic nominee Paul Lafayette in the election.[74] He said he would not seek another mayoral term after the 1987 election: ""eight years is enough and I think it is time for new leadership, which does exist within the coalition, to come up"".[75]

Sanders did not run for a fifth term as mayor. He went on to lecture in political science at Harvard Kennedy School that year and at Hamilton College in 1991.[76]

Administration

During his mayoralty, Sanders called himself a socialist and was described as such in the press.[77][78] During his first term, his supporters, including the first Citizens Party city councilor Terry Bouricius, formed the Progressive Coalition, the forerunner of the Vermont Progressive Party.[79] The Progressives never held more than six seats on the 13-member city council, but they had enough to keep the council from overriding Sanders's vetoes. Under his leadership, Burlington balanced its city budget; attracted a minor league baseball team, the Vermont Reds, then the Double-A affiliate of the Cincinnati Reds;[18] became the first U.S. city to fund community-trust housing;[80] and successfully sued the local cable television franchise, thereby winning reduced rates for customers.[18]

As mayor, Sanders also led extensive downtown revitalization projects. One of his primary achievements was improving Burlington's Lake Champlain waterfront.[18] In 1981, he campaigned against the unpopular plans by Burlington developer Tony Pomerleau to convert the then-industrial[81] waterfront property owned by the Central Vermont Railway into expensive condominiums, hotels, and offices.[82] He ran under the slogan ""Burlington is not for sale"" and successfully supported a plan that redeveloped the waterfront area into a mixed-use district featuring housing, parks, and public spaces.[82]

Sanders was a consistent critic of U.S. foreign policy in Latin America throughout the 1980s.[83] In 1985, Burlington City Hall hosted a foreign policy speech by Noam Chomsky. In his introduction, he praised Chomsky as ""a very vocal and important voice in the wilderness of intellectual life in America"" and said that he was ""delighted to welcome a person who I think we're all very proud of"".[84][85]

Sanders hosted and produced a public-access television program, Bernie Speaks with the Community, from 1986 to 1988.[86][87] He collaborated with 30 Vermont musicians to record a folk album, We Shall Overcome, in 1987.[88][89] That same year, U.S. News & World Report ranked Sanders one of America's best mayors.[90][91] As of 2013 , Burlington was regarded as one of the most livable cities in the United States.[92][93]

During a trip to the Soviet Union in 1988, Sanders interviewed the mayor of Burlington's sister city Yaroslavl about housing and health care issues in the two cities.[94][95]

When Sanders left office in 1989, Bouricius, a member of the Burlington city council, said that Sanders had ""changed the entire nature of politics in Burlington and also in the state of Vermont"".[96]

U.S. House of Representatives (1991–2007)

Elections

In 1988, incumbent Republican congressman Jim Jeffords decided to run for the U.S. Senate, vacating the House seat representing Vermont's at-large congressional district. Former lieutenant governor Peter P. Smith won the House election with a plurality, securing 41% of the vote. Sanders, who ran as an independent, placed second with 38% of the vote, while Democratic state representative Paul N. Poirier placed third with 19%.[97] Two years later, he ran for the seat again and defeated Smith by a margin of 56% to 39%.[98] Sanders was the first independent elected to the U.S. House of Representatives since Frazier Reams of Ohio won his second term in 1952,[99] as well as the first socialist elected to the House since Vito Marcantonio, from the American Labor Party, who won his last term in 1948.[100][99] Sanders was a representative from 1991 until he became a senator in 2007, winning reelection by large margins except during the 1994 Republican Revolution, when he won by 3%, with 50% of the vote.[101]

Legislation

During his first year in the House, Sanders often alienated allies and colleagues with his criticism of both political parties as working primarily on behalf of the wealthy. In 1991, he co-founded the Congressional Progressive Caucus, a group of mostly liberal Democrats that he chaired for its first eight years,[18] while still refusing to join the Democratic Party or caucus.[102]

In 2005, Rolling Stone called Sanders the ""amendment king"" for his ability to get more roll call amendments passed than any other congressman during the period since 1995, when Congress was entirely under Republican control. Being an independent allowed him to form coalitions across party lines.[103]

Banking reform

In 1999, Sanders voted and advocated against rolling back the Glass–Steagall legislation provisions that kept investment banks and commercial banks separate entities.[104] He was a vocal critic of Federal Reserve chair Alan Greenspan; in June 2003, during a question-and-answer discussion, Sanders told him he was concerned that he was ""way out of touch"" and ""that you see your major function in your position as the need to represent the wealthy and large corporations.""[105][106][107][108]

Cancer registries

Concerned by high breast cancer rates in Vermont, on February 7, 1992, Sanders sponsored the Cancer Registries Amendment Act to establish cancer registries to collect data on cancer.[109][110] Senator Patrick Leahy introduced a companion bill in the Senate on October 2, 1992. The Senate bill was passed by the House on October 6 and signed into law by President George H. W. Bush on October 24, 1992.[111]

Firearms and criminal justice

In 1993, Sanders voted against the Brady Bill, which mandated federal background checks when buying guns and imposed a waiting period on firearm purchasers in the United States; the bill passed by a vote of 238–187.[112][113] He voted against the bill four more times in the 1990s, explaining his Vermont constituents saw waiting-period mandates as more appropriately a state than federal matter.[114]

Sanders did vote for other gun-control measures.[115][112] For example, in 1994, he voted for the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act ""because it included the Violence Against Women Act and the ban on certain assault weapons."" He was nevertheless critical of the other parts of the bill.[116][117] Although he acknowledged that ""clearly, there are some people in our society who are horribly violent, who are deeply sick and sociopathic, and clearly these people must be put behind bars in order to protect society from them"", he maintained that governmental policies played a large part in ""dooming tens of millions of young people to a future of bitterness, misery, hopelessness, drugs, crime, and violence"" and argued that the repressive policies introduced by the bill were not addressing the causes of violence, saying, ""we can create meaningful jobs, rebuilding our society, or we can build more jails.""[118]

Sanders has at times favored stronger law enforcement and sentencing. In 1996, he voted against a bill that would have prohibited police from purchasing tanks and armored carriers.[119][120] In 1998, he voted for a bill that would have increased minimum sentencing for possessing a gun while committing a federal crime to ten years in prison, including nonviolent crimes such as marijuana possession.[119][112][121]

In 2005, Sanders voted for the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act.[122] The purpose of the act was to prevent firearms manufacturers and dealers from being held liable for negligence when crimes have been committed with their products.[123] As of 2016 , he said that he has since changed his position and would vote for legislation to defeat this bill.[124]

Opposition to the Patriot Act

Sanders was a consistent critic of the Patriot Act.[125] As a member of Congress, he voted against the original Patriot Act legislation.[126] After its 357–66 passage in the House, he sponsored and voted for several subsequent amendments and acts attempting to curtail its effects[127] and voted against each reauthorization.[128] In June 2005, he proposed an amendment to limit Patriot Act provisions that allow the government to obtain individuals' library and book-buying records. The amendment passed the House by a bipartisan majority but was removed on November 4 of that year in House–Senate negotiations and never became law.[129]

Opposition to the War in Iraq

Sanders meeting with students at Milton High School in Milton, Vermont, 2004

Sanders voted against the resolutions authorizing the use of force against Iraq in 1991 and 2002, and he opposed the 2003 invasion of Iraq. He voted for the 2001 Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Terrorists[130] that has been cited as the legal justification for controversial military actions since the September 11 attacks.[131] He especially opposed the Bush administration's decision to start a war unilaterally.[132][133]

Trade policy

In February 2005, Sanders introduced a bill that would have withdrawn the permanent normal trade relations (PNTR) status that had been extended to China in October 2000. He said to the House, ""Anyone who takes an objective look at our trade policy with China must conclude that it is an absolute failure and needs to be fundamentally overhauled"", citing the American jobs being lost to overseas competitors. His bill received 71 co-sponsors but was not sent to the floor for a vote.[134][135]

U.S. Senate (2007–present)

Elections

2006

Senate portrait, 2007

Sanders entered the race for the U.S. Senate on April 21, 2005, after Senator Jim Jeffords announced that he would not seek a fourth term. Chuck Schumer, chair of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee and fellow James Madison High School alumnus, endorsed Sanders. This was a critical move because it meant no Democrat running against him could expect financial help from the party. He was also endorsed by Senate minority leader Harry Reid and Democratic National Committee chair and former Vermont governor Howard Dean. Dean said in May 2005 that he considered Sanders an ally who ""votes with the Democrats 98% of the time.""[136] Then-Senator Barack Obama also campaigned for him in Vermont in March 2006.[137] Sanders entered into an agreement with the Democratic Party, much as he had as a congressman, to be listed in their primary but to decline the nomination should he win, which he did.[138][139]

Sanders being sworn in for his second term in 2013 by Joe Biden

In the most expensive political campaign in Vermont's history,[140] Sanders defeated businessman Rich Tarrant by an almost 2-to-1 margin. Many national media outlets projected him as the winner just after the polls closed, before any returns came in.

2012

Sanders was reelected in 2012 with 71% of the vote.[141]

2018

Sanders was reelected in 2018 with 67% of the vote.[142]

2024

On May 6, 2024, Sanders announced his candidacy for a fourth Senate term.[143][144][145] A poll just a few weeks earlier found that more than half of respondents wanted him to seek reelection.[146] Sanders faced Republican nominee Gerald Malloy, who ran against Senator Peter Welch in 2022.[147] Sanders was reelected and has said this term will likely be his last.[148][4]

Legislation

While a member of Congress, Sanders sponsored 15 concurrent resolutions and 15 Senate resolutions.[149] Of those he co-sponsored, 218 became law.[150][151] While he has consistently advocated for progressive causes, Politico wrote that he has ""rarely forged actual legislation or left a significant imprint on it.""[152] According to The New York Times, ""Big legislation largely eludes Mr. Sanders because his ideas are usually far to the left of the majority of the Senate ... Mr. Sanders has largely found ways to press his agenda through appending small provisions to the larger bills of others.""[153] During his time in the Senate, he had lower legislative effectiveness than the average senator, as measured by the number of sponsored bills that passed and successful amendments made.[154] Nevertheless, he has sponsored over 500 amendments to bills,[155] many of which became law. The results of these amendments include a ban on imported goods made by child labor; $100 million in funding for community health centers; $10 million for an outreach program for servicemembers who have post-traumatic stress disorder, traumatic brain injury, depression, panic attacks, and other mental disorders; a public database of senior Department of Defense officials seeking employment with defense contractors; and including autism treatment under the military healthcare program Tricare.[156]

In August 2022, Sanders voted for the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022.[157] He was not satisfied with the bill, calling it only a small step forward. Sanders joined with Democrats to pass the Inflation Reduction Act, which capped the cost of insulin for seniors on Medicare to $35 a month and allowed Medicare to negotiate lower drug prices.[158]

Finance and monetary policy

In 2008 and 2009, Sanders voted against the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP), a program to purchase toxic banking assets and provide loans to banks that were in free-fall.[159][160] On February 4, 2009, he sponsored an amendment to ensure that TARP funds would not displace U.S. workers. The amendment passed and was added to the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009.[156][161] Among his proposed financial reforms is auditing the Federal Reserve, which would reduce its independence in monetary policy deliberations; Federal Reserve officials say that ""Audit the Fed"" legislation would expose the Federal Reserve to undue political pressure from lawmakers who do not like its decisions.[162][163][164]

Sanders spoke for more than eight hours in his December 2010 filibuster.

On December 10, 2010, Sanders delivered an 8-hour and 34-minute speech against the Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010,[d] which proposed extending the Bush-era tax rates. He argued that the legislation would favor the wealthiest Americans. ""Enough is enough! ... How many homes can you own?"" he asked.[166][167][168] Nevertheless, the bill passed the Senate with a strong majority and was signed into law a week later.[169] In February 2011, Nation Books published the speech as The Speech: A Historic Filibuster on Corporate Greed and the Decline of Our Middle Class, with authorial proceeds going to Vermont nonprofit charitable organizations.[170]

In 2016, Sanders voted for the Federal Reserve Transparency Act, which included proposals for a reformed audit of the Federal Reserve System.[162][163][164]

Foreign policy

On June 12, 2017, U.S. senators agreed to legislation imposing new sanctions on Russia and Iran.[171] The bill was opposed only by Sanders and Republican Rand Paul.[172] He supported the sanctions on Russia, but voted against the bill because he believed the sanctions could endanger the Iran nuclear deal.[173]

In 2018, Sanders sponsored a bill and was joined by senators Chris Murphy (D–CT) and Mike Lee (R–UT) to invoke the 1973 War Powers Resolution to end U.S. support for the Saudi-led military intervention in Yemen,[174] which has resulted in hundreds of thousands of civilian casualties[175] and ""millions more suffering from starvation and disease"".[176][177] After the assassination of Jamal Khashoggi in October 2018 (which was ordered by Saudi Arabian crown prince Mohammad bin Salman, according to multiple intelligence agencies),[174][175][176][178] his bill attracted bipartisan co-sponsors and support, and the Senate passed it by a vote of 56–41.[179] The bill passed the House in February 2019 by a 247–175 vote and President Trump vetoed it in March, saying: ""This resolution is an unnecessary, dangerous attempt to weaken my constitutional authorities, endangering the lives of American citizens and brave service members, both today and in the future.""[180]

Health care

Don't Take Our Health Care rally in Columbus, Ohio, June 2017

In mid-December 2009, Sanders successfully added a provision to the Affordable Care Act to fund $11 billion to community health centers, especially those in rural areas. The provision brought together Democrats on the left with Democrats from conservative, rural areas, helping to secure the 60 votes needed for passage.[156] On May 4, 2017, in response to the House vote to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, he predicted ""thousands of Americans would die"" from no longer having access to health care.[181] PolitiFact rated his statement ""mostly true"".[182]

In September 2017, Sanders along with 15 Senate co-sponsors submitted the Medicare for All bill, a single-payer healthcare plan. The bill covers vision and dental care, unlike Medicare. Some Republicans have called the bill ""Berniecare"" and ""the latest Democratic push for socialized medicine and higher taxes."" He responded that the Republican Party has no credibility on the issue of health care after voting for legislation that would take health insurance away from 32 million Americans under the Affordable Care Act.[183]

As chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on Primary Health and Aging, Sanders introduced legislation in 2013 to reauthorize and strengthen the Older Americans Act, which supports Meals on Wheels and other programs for seniors.[184]

Immigration policy

In 2007, Sanders helped kill a bill introducing comprehensive immigration reform, arguing that its guest-worker program would depress wages for American workers.[185] In 2010, he supported the DREAM Act, which would have provided a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants who had been brought to the United States as minors.[185] In 2013, he supported the Gang of Eight's comprehensive immigration reform bill after securing a $1.5 billion youth jobs program provision, which he argued would offset the harm of labor market competition with immigrants.[185]

Income and wealth distribution

In April 2017, Sanders introduced a bill that would raise the minimum wage for federal contract workers to $15 an hour, an increase over an earlier Democratic $12 an hour proposal.[186] On May 9, 2018, he introduced the Workplace Democracy Act, a bill that would expand labor rights by making it easier for workers to join a union, ban right-to-work laws and some anti-union provisions of the Taft–Hartley Act, and outlaw some union-busting tactics. Announcing the legislation, he said, ""If we are serious about reducing income and wealth inequality and rebuilding the middle class, we have got to substantially increase the number of union jobs in this country.""[187]

Sanders opposed the 2018 United States federal budget proposed by the Trump administration, calling it ""a budget for the billionaire class, for Wall Street, for corporate CEOs, and for the wealthiest people in this country ... nothing less than a massive transfer of wealth from working families, the elderly, children, the sick and the poor to the top 1%.""[188]

After the November 2017 revelations from the Paradise Papers and a recent report from the Institute for Policy Studies which says just three people (Jeff Bezos, Bill Gates, and Warren Buffett) own more wealth than the bottom half of the U.S. population, Sanders stated that ""we must end global oligarchy"" and that ""we need, in the United States and throughout the world, a tax system which is fair, progressive and transparent.""[189]

On September 5, 2018, Sanders partnered with Ro Khanna to introduce the Stop Bad Employers by Zeroing Out Subsidies (Stop BEZOS) Act, which would require large corporations to pay for the food stamps and Medicaid benefits that their employees receive, relieving the burden on taxpayers.[190][191]

Veterans affairs

On June 9, 2014, Sanders sponsored the Veterans' Access to Care through Choice, Accountability, and Transparency Act of 2014 to reform the Department of Veterans Affairs in the wake of the Veterans Health Administration scandal of 2014. He worked with Senator John McCain, who co-sponsored the bill.[192][193] His bill was incorporated into the House version of the bill, which passed both chambers on July 31, 2014, and was signed into law by President Obama on August 7, 2014.[194]

Supreme Court nominees

On March 17, 2016, Sanders said he would support Merrick Garland's nomination to the Supreme Court, though he added, ""there are some more progressive judges out there.""[195] He opposed Neil Gorsuch's nomination to the court, saying that Gorsuch had ""refused to answer legitimate questions"".[196] He also objected to Senate Republicans' use of the nuclear option to ""choke off debate and ram [Gorsuch's] nomination through the Senate"".[196] He voted against Gorsuch's confirmation as an associate justice and against Trump's nominees Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett.[197][198][199] In 2022, Sanders voted to confirm Joe Biden's nominee Ketanji Brown Jackson to the Supreme Court.[200]

Committee assignments

As an independent, Sanders maintains an agreement with the Senate Democratic leadership where he votes with the Democrats on all procedural matters unless the Democratic whip, Dick Durbin, agrees that he need not (a request rarely made or granted). In return he was allowed to keep his seniority and received the committee seats that would have been available to him as a Democrat; in 2013–14 he was chairman of the United States Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs (during the Veterans Health Administration scandal).[201][202]

Sanders became the ranking minority member on the Senate Budget Committee in 2015 and the chair in 2021; he previously chaired the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee for two years. Since 2017, he has been chair of the Senate Democratic Outreach Committee.[202] He appointed economics professor Stephanie Kelton, a modern monetary theory scholar, as the chief economic adviser for the committee's Democratic minority and presented a report about helping ""rebuild the disappearing middle class"" that included proposals to raise the minimum wage, boost infrastructure spending, and increase Social Security payments.[203]

Caucus memberships

Sanders was only the third senator from Vermont to caucus with the Democrats, after Jeffords and Leahy. His caucusing with the Democrats gave them a 51–49 majority in the Senate during the 110th Congress in 2007–08. The Democrats needed 51 seats to control the Senate because Vice President Dick Cheney would likely have broken potential ties in favor of the Republicans.[205] He is a member of the following caucuses:

Approval ratings

Polling conducted in August 2011 by Public Policy Polling found that Sanders's approval rating was 67% and his disapproval rating 28%, making him then the third-most popular U.S. senator.[208] Both the NAACP (National Association for the Advancement of Colored People) and the NHLA (National Hispanic Leadership Agenda) have given him 100% voting scores during his tenure in the Senate.[209] In 2015, he was named one of the Top 5 of The Forward 50.[210] In a November 2015 Morning Consult poll, he reached an 83% approval rating among his constituents, making him the most popular U.S. senator.[211] Fox News found him to have the highest net favorability at +28 points of any prominent politician included in its March 2017 poll.[212] He ranked third in 2014 and first in both 2015 and 2016.[211][208][213]

In April 2017, a nationwide Harvard-Harris Poll found that Sanders had the highest favorability rating among all the political figures included in the poll,[214] a standing confirmed by subsequent polling.[215]

2016 presidential campaign

Sanders rally in Portland, Oregon, August 2015

Sanders speaking at Rutgers University in May 2016

During the 2012 Democratic presidential primaries, Sanders—dissatisfied with President Obama's ""attempts to trade Social Security cuts for tax hikes""—reportedly considered running against him in the primaries. Sanders had previously suggested in 2011 that it was ""a good idea"" for someone to challenge Obama and ""got so close to running a primary challenge ... that Senator Harry Reid had to intervene to stop him.""[216] In November 2013, Sanders suggested that Senator Elizabeth Warren could be president and that she might earn his backing if she ran. He added that if no progressive candidate ran, he might feel compelled to do so himself.[217][218] In December 2014, Warren said she was not running.[219]

Sanders announced his intention to seek the Democratic Party's nomination for president on April 30, 2015.[220][221][222][223] His campaign was officially launched on May 26 in Burlington.[222] In his announcement, Sanders said, ""I don't believe that the men and women who defended American democracy fought to create a situation where billionaires own the political process"" and made this a central idea throughout his campaign.[221][222]

Warren welcomed Sanders's entry into the race, saying, ""I'm glad to see him get out there and give his version of what leadership in this country should be"", but never endorsed him.[224][225]

Initially considered a long shot, Sanders won 23 primaries and caucuses and around 46% of pledged delegates to Hillary Clinton's 54%. His campaign was noted for its supporters' enthusiasm, as well as for rejecting large donations from corporations, the financial industry, and any associated Super PAC. Some of the Democratic National Committee (DNC) emails leaked to the public in June and July 2016 showed that the committee leadership had favored Clinton over him and had worked to help Clinton win the nomination.[226]

On July 12, 2016, Sanders formally endorsed Clinton in her unsuccessful general election campaign against Republican Donald Trump, while urging his supporters to continue the ""political revolution"" his campaign had begun.[227] Following his endorsement, Sanders spent weeks campaigning for Clinton,[228] holding 39 rallies in 13 states during the final three months before the 2016 election.[229]

Campaign methods

Unlike the other major candidates, Sanders did not pursue funding through a Super PAC or from wealthy donors, instead focusing on small-dollar donations.[230] His presidential campaign raised $1.5 million within 24 hours of his official announcement.[231] At the end of the year, the campaign had raised a total of $73 million from more than one million people, making 2.5 million donations, with an average donation of $27.16.[232] The campaign reached 3.25 million donations by the end of January 2016, raising $20 million in that month alone.[233]

Sanders used social media to help his campaign gain momentum,[234] posting content to online platforms such as Twitter and Facebook and answering questions on Reddit. He gained a large grassroots organizational following online. A July 29, 2015, meetup organized online brought 100,000 supporters to more than 3,500 simultaneous events nationwide.[235]

To his surprise, Sanders's June 2015 campaign events drew overflow crowds across the country.[236][237][238] When Clinton and Sanders made public appearances within days of each other in Des Moines, Iowa, he drew larger crowds, even though he had already made many stops around the state and Clinton's visit was her first in 2015.[239] On July 1, 2015, his campaign stop in Madison, Wisconsin, drew the largest crowd of any 2016 presidential candidate to that date, with an estimated turnout of 10,000.[240][241] Over the following weeks, he drew even larger crowds: 11,000 in Phoenix;[242] 15,000 in Seattle;[243] and 28,000 in Portland, Oregon.[244]

Presidential debates

The Democratic National Committee (DNC) announced in May 2015 that there would be six debates. Critics alleged that the small number of debates and the schedule, with half of the debates on Saturday or Sunday nights, were part of the DNC's deliberate attempt to protect Clinton, who was perceived as the front-runner.[245] In February 2016, both the Clinton and Sanders campaigns agreed in principle to holding four more debates for a total of ten.[246] Clinton dropped out of the tenth debate, scheduled to take place just before the California primary, citing a need to devote her time to making direct contact with California voters and preparing for the general election.[247] Sanders expressed disappointment that Clinton canceled the debate before what he believed would be ""the largest and most important primary in the presidential nominating process.""[248]

Polls and news coverage

Some Sanders supporters raised concerns that publications such as The New York Times minimized coverage of the Sanders campaign in favor of other candidates, especially Trump and Clinton. The Times' ombudsman reviewed her paper's coverage of the Sanders campaign and found that as of September 2015 the Times ""hasn't always taken it very seriously. The tone of some stories is regrettably dismissive, even mocking at times. Some of that is focused on the candidate's age, appearance and style, rather than what he has to say."" She also found that the Times's coverage of Sanders's campaign was much scanter than its coverage of Trump's, though Trump's was also initially considered a long shot at that time, with 63 articles covering the Trump campaign and 14 covering Sanders's.[249][250] A December 2015 report found that the three major networks—CBS, NBC, and ABC—had spent 234 minutes reporting on Trump and 10 minutes on Sanders, despite their similar polling results. The report noted that ABC World News Tonight had spent 81 minutes on Trump and less than one minute on Sanders during 2015.[251]

A study of media coverage in the 2016 election concluded that while Sanders received less coverage than his rival Hillary Clinton, the amount of coverage of Sanders during the election was largely consistent with his polling performance, except during 2015 when Sanders received coverage that far exceeded his standing in the polls.[252] Studies concluded that the tone of media coverage of Sanders was more favorable than that of any other candidate, whereas his main opponent in the Democratic primary, Hillary Clinton, received the most negative coverage of any candidate.[253][252] All 2016 candidates received vastly less media coverage than Donald Trump, and the Democratic primary received substantially less coverage than the Republican primary.[252][253][254]

Amy Goodman of Democracy Now! noted that on March 15, Super Tuesday III, the speeches of Trump, Clinton, Marco Rubio, and Ted Cruz were broadcast in full. Sanders was in Phoenix, Arizona, on that date, speaking to a rally larger than any of the others, yet his speech was not mentioned, let alone broadcast.[255] However, political scientist Rachel Bitecofer wrote in her 2018 book about the 2016 election that the Democratic primary was effectively over in terms of delegate count by mid-March 2016, but that the media promoted the narrative that the contest between Sanders and Clinton was ""heating up"" at that time.[254]

An NBC/Wall Street Journal poll conducted in May 2016 found Clinton and Trump (by then the presumptive Republican nominee) in a ""dead heat"", but the same poll found that if Sanders were the Democratic nominee, 53% of voters would support him to 39% for Trump.[256] Clinton and Trump were the least popular likely candidates ever polled, while Sanders received a 43% positive, 36% negative rating.[257] Polls showed that Democratic voters older than 50 preferred Clinton by a large margin but that those under 50 overwhelmingly favored Sanders.[258] A 2017 analysis in Newsweek found that 12% of those who voted for Sanders in the Democratic primary voted for Trump in the general election,[259] a lower proportion than that of Clinton supporters in 2008 who voted for John McCain.[260][261]

DNC email leak

In July 2016, a leak of the Democratic National Committee's emails appeared to show DNC officials favoring Clinton over Sanders. Staff repeatedly discussed making his irreligious tendencies a potential campaign issue in southern states and questioned his party loyalty. DNC chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz called his campaign manager ""an ass"" and ""a damn liar"".[262] Speaking with Jake Tapper on CNN, Sanders responded to the leak, saying, ""it is an outrage and sad that you would have people in important positions in the DNC trying to undermine my campaign. It goes without saying: the function of the DNC is to represent all of the candidates—to be fair and even-minded. But again, we discussed this many, many months ago, on this show, so what is revealed now is not a shock to me.""[263]

Endorsement of Hillary Clinton

After the final primary election, Clinton became the presumptive Democratic nominee.[264] On July 12, Sanders formally endorsed Clinton.[227] He said he would continue to work with the Democratic National Convention organizers to implement progressive positions. Sanders refused to formally concede before the convention.[265] He spoke at the 2016 Democratic National Convention on July 25, during which he gave Clinton his full support. Some of his supporters attempted to protest Clinton's nomination and booed when Sanders called for party unity. He responded, ""Our job is to do two things: to defeat Donald Trump and to elect Hillary Clinton ... It is easy to boo, but it is harder to look your kids in the face if we are living under a Trump presidency.""[266]

On November 8, in the general election, Sanders received almost 6% of the vote in Vermont, even though he was no longer a candidate. This was the highest share of a statewide presidential vote for a write-in draft campaign in American history.[267] He also received more votes in Vermont than Gary Johnson, the Libertarian candidate, and Jill Stein, the Green candidate, combined.[268] It was possible to vote for Sanders as a write-in candidate in 12 states,[269] and exact totals of write-in votes for him were published in three of them: California,[270] New Hampshire,[271] and Vermont.[268] In those three states, he received 111,850 write-in votes, about 15% of the write-in votes nationwide, and less than 1% of total nationwide vote.[269]

Post-election activities

In November 2016, Sanders's book Our Revolution: A Future to Believe In was released; upon its release, it was number three on The New York Times Best Seller list.[272] The audiobook later received a Grammy nomination for Best Spoken Word Album.[273] In February 2017, he began webcasting The Bernie Sanders Show on Facebook live streaming. As of April 2, 2017 , guests had included William Barber, Josh Fox, Jane Mayer, and Bill Nye.[274][275] Polls taken in 2017 found him to be the most popular politician in the United States.[214][276]

In February 2018, Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. elections concluded that Russians had communicated false information during the primary campaigns to help Sanders and Stein and harm Clinton.[277] Sanders rejected the investigation's conclusion, saying that he had seen no evidence that Russians had helped his campaign.[278] Furthermore, he questioned the Clinton campaign's lack of action to prevent Russian interference.[278] He later said that his campaign had taken action to prevent Russian meddling in the election and that a campaign staffer had alerted the Clinton campaign.[279] Politico noted that a Sanders campaign volunteer contacted a political action committee (PAC) that supported the Clinton campaign to report suspicious activities but that the Sanders campaign did not contact the Clinton campaign as such.[279]

In November 2018, the Sanders Institute and Yanis Varoufakis, co-founder of DiEM25, launched Progressive International, an international organization uniting progressive activists and organizations ""to mobilize people around the world to transform the global order and the institutions that shape it.""[280][281][282]

Influence on the Democratic Party

Analysts have suggested that Sanders's campaign shifted both the Clinton campaign and the Democratic Party politically leftward. A new political organization, Brand New Congress, was formed in April 2016 by former campaign staffers. It works to elect congressional representatives with platforms in line with Sanders.[283] In August 2016, he formed Our Revolution, a political organization dedicated to educating voters about issues, getting people involved in the political process, and electing progressive candidates for local, state, and national office.[284][285] Speaking on the PBS Newshour about the upcoming 2018 elections and discussing the main principles of the two major parties, Susan Page described the Republican Party as ""Trump's party"" and the Democratic Party as ""Bernie Sanders's party"", saying that ""Sanders and his more progressive stance has really taken hold.""[286] Noting the increasing acceptance of his national single-payer health-care program, his $15-an-hour minimum wage stance, free college tuition, and many of the other campaign platform issues he introduced,[287][288] an April 2018 opinion article in The Week suggested, ""Quietly but steadily, the Democratic Party is admitting that Sanders was right.""[289] In July 2016, a Slate article called the Democratic platform draft ""a monument to his campaign"", noting not only his call for a $15 minimum wage but other campaign issues, such as Social Security expansion, a carbon tax, Wall Street reform, opposition to the death penalty, and a ""reasoned pathway for future legalization"" of marijuana.[290]

Sanders's presidential campaigns led to a resurgence of interest in social democracy and democratic socialism among millennials.[291]

2020 presidential campaign

On February 19, 2019, Sanders announced that he would seek the Democratic Party's 2020 nomination for president.[292] He had declined the Vermont Democratic Party nomination for U.S. Senate in 2006, 2012, and 2018, which caused an unsuccessful legal challenge to his candidacy for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2016. Along with his 2019 campaign announcement, he said he would abide by a new Democratic Party rule for presidential candidates and that he would affirm his membership in that party.[293] On March 5, 2019, he signed a formal statement, known as a ""loyalty pledge"", that he is a member of the Democratic Party and will serve as a Democrat if elected. News reports noted that the day before, he had signed paperwork to run as an independent for reelection to his Senate seat in 2024.[294]

Sanders's campaign manager was Faiz Shakir. The campaign's national co-chairs were Ben & Jerry's co-founder Ben Cohen, Representative Ro Khanna, Our Revolution president Nina Turner, and San Juan mayor Carmen Yulín Cruz.[295][296]

Campaign methods

Given the high national profile that Sanders maintained since his 2016 campaign, NPR described him as ""no longer an underdog"" when he announced his 2020 campaign.[297] Using the large email list it built during the 2016 campaign, the 2020 campaign recruited more than one million volunteers within weeks of its launch. It enlisted several former NowThis News employees to produce professional videos for wide social media distribution, live-streamed various forums to its millions of social media followers, and launched a podcast and smartphone app for grassroots organizing.[298]

Fundraising

Sanders's 2020 campaign employed many of the same methods as its 2016 counterpart, eschewing a Super PAC and relying predominantly on small-dollar contributions. According to Federal Election Commission filings, the Sanders campaign had raised the most money in the 2020 Democratic field as of June 2019, including money left over from his 2018 Senate and 2016 presidential races.[299][300][301] In September 2019, the Sanders campaign became the fastest in U.S. history to reach one million donors.[302] On October 1, 2019, the campaign announced it had raised $25.3 million in the year's third quarter, with an average donation of $18. It was the largest quarterly sum raised by any Democratic candidate.[303][304] The campaign raised $34.5 million during the fourth quarter of 2019.[305]

Polls and news coverage

Sanders campaigning for president in San Jose, California, March 2020

Sanders steadily polled between 15% and 20% on most national surveys between May and September 2019, according to the RealClearPolitics average. This placed him in a decisive second-place behind Joe Biden until Elizabeth Warren and Kamala Harris caught up in July.[306] From mid-February 2020 to the start of March, Sanders polled in first place in the Democratic primary ahead of Joe Biden[307][308] and was described by the press as the party's presidential front-runner.[309][310][311][312]

According to a RealClearPolitics analysis, Sanders received the third-most mentions on CNN, Fox News, and MSNBC between January and August 2019, trailing only Joe Biden and Kamala Harris. Biden, however, received twice as many mentions as Sanders and Harris. Mentions of Sanders on ABC World News Tonight found him in second place, though also trailing Biden by a large margin. Online mentions ""reflect a slightly more balanced picture"", with both Sanders and Elizabeth Warren running ""neck-and-neck"" with Biden.[313]

Forums and other appearances

On April 6, 2019, Sanders participated in a Fox News town hall that attracted more than 2.55 million viewers.[314][315] His decision to appear on Fox was controversial, given the Democratic National Committee's decision not to allow Fox to host any of its debates.[316][317] His appearance saw an increase of Fox News viewers by 24% overall and 40% in the 25-to-54-year-old demographic, surpassing the ratings of all other Democratic presidential candidate town halls that year. As of September 2019, the town hall had received more than 1.5 million views on YouTube.[318]

On August 6, 2019, Sanders appeared on The Joe Rogan Experience podcast. Some praised Rogan for ""hosting a pragmatic discussion"" while others ""seemed rather stunned by Sanders's decision to appear on the show at all."" After the podcast, Rogan became a top-trending Twitter topic.[319] After interviewing him, Rogan said, ""I am not right-wing ... I've interviewed right-wing people. I am 100% left-wing ... Bernie Sanders made a ton of sense to me and I would 100% vote for him.""[320] As of October 2019, the podcast had received more than ten million views on YouTube.[321]

Presidential debates

In December 2018, the Democratic National Committee (DNC) announced the preliminary schedule for 12 official DNC-sanctioned debates, set to begin in June 2019, with six in 2019 and the remaining six during the first four months of 2020. During the July and September debates, commentators described Sanders and Elizabeth Warren as having a ""non-aggression pact"", staking out similar progressive positions in contrast to the more conservative candidates.[322][323] In the October 15 debate, his first appearance since his heart attack, debate coach Todd Graham gave Sanders's performance an A, his highest rating of all the candidates.[324]

CNN hosted the first 2020 debate in January with six candidates remaining. Co-moderator Abby Phillip questioned Sanders and Warren about an allegation Warren had made that he had privately told her that a woman could not defeat Donald Trump. Phillip asked Sanders, ""Senator Sanders, CNN reported yesterday, and Senator Warren confirmed in a statement, that in 2018 you told her that you did not believe that a woman could win the election. Why did you say that?"" Ignoring Sanders's strong denial, Phillip asked Warren, ""What did you think when Bernie Sanders told you that a woman couldn't become president?"" In an interview after the debate, Sanders called it ludicrous to believe that he would doubt a woman's ability to win the presidency and noted that a woman already had won the national popular vote, saying, ""After all, Hillary Clinton beat Donald Trump by 3 million votes in 2016.""[325]

Suspension of campaign

Sanders announced that he was suspending his campaign on April 8, 2020.[326][327][328] He stated that he would remain on the ballot in the remaining states and continue to accumulate delegates with the goal of influencing the Democratic Party's platform.[329][326][330] On April 14, Sanders endorsed Biden. Biden responded, ""I think that your endorsement means a great deal. It means a great deal to me. I think people are going to be surprised that we are apart on some issues but we're awfully close on a whole bunch of others. I'm going to need you—not just to win the campaign, but to govern.""[331]

2025 Fight Oligarchy

In February 2025, weeks into the 2nd Trump administration, and amid concerns that the Democratic Party hadn't mustered robust opposition,[332][333] Sanders launched a ""Fight Oligarchy"" tour of Midwest districts that Republicans won but could be winnable by Democrats in the 2026 House elections. Sanders rallied in places like Omaha, Nebraska;[334][335] Iowa City, Iowa;[336][337]; Kenosha, Wisconsin;[338][339][340] and Warren, Michigan.[341][342]

Political positions

A self-described democratic socialist,[343] Sanders is a progressive and left-wing populist who admires social democratic programs in Europe and supports workplace democracy via union democracy, worker cooperatives, and workers' management of public enterprises.[344][345][346][347] He is a strong critic of contemporary neoliberal capitalism, which he calls ""uber-capitalism"", blaming it for such societal ills as declining life expectancy and rising diseases of despair.[348][349][347] He advocates universal, single-payer healthcare, paid parental leave, and tuition-free tertiary education.[350] He supports lowering the cost of drugs by reforming patent laws to allow cheaper generic versions to be sold in the U.S.[351] He supported the Affordable Care Act, though he said it did not go far enough.[352] In November 2015, he gave a speech at Georgetown University about his view of democratic socialism, including its place in the policies of presidents Franklin D. Roosevelt and Lyndon B. Johnson.[353][354] Defining what ""democratic socialism"" means to him, Sanders said: ""I don't believe government should take over the grocery store down the street or own the means of production, but I do believe that the middle class and the working families who produce the wealth of America deserve a decent standard of living and that their incomes should go up, not down.""[355]

Based on his positions and votes throughout his career, many commentators consider his political platform primarily focused on tax-funded social benefits inspired by the Nordic model and not on social ownership of the means of production.[356][357] Some socialists and major socialist organizations have described Sanders as a democratic socialist, market socialist, or reformist socialist,[358][359][360][361] while others have called him a reformist social democrat.[362][363][364]

Bhaskar Sunkara has characterized Sanders' politics as ""class struggle social democracy"", arguing that while postwar social democracy operated as a compromise that instituted tripartite arrangements between business, labor, and government to dampen class conflict, Sanders sees social democratic demands as a means to sharpening class confrontation and raising class consciousness.[365] His views have been echoed by George Eaton, arguing that Sunkara's phrase ""captures the nuances of Sanders' politics in a way that a socialist / social democrat binary does not"" and asserting that if he was elected president it would represent ""the triumph of a politics that is neither wholly socialist, nor social democratic, but a new fusion of both"".[366]

Climate change

Sanders views global warming as a serious problem,[367] and advocates bold action to reverse its effects. He calls for substantial investment in infrastructure, with energy efficiency, sustainability, and job creation as prominent goals.[368][369] He considers climate change the greatest threat to national security.[370][367] He said that family planning can help fight climate change.[371] He opposed the construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline on the grounds that, like the Keystone XL Pipeline, it ""will have a significant impact on our climate.""[372] In 2019, he announced his support for Green New Deal legislation[373] and joined representatives Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Earl Blumenauer in proposing legislation that would declare climate change a national and international emergency.[374]

Economic issues

Sanders focuses on economic issues such as income and wealth inequality,[343][375] poverty,[376] raising the minimum wage,[186] universal healthcare,[350] cancelling all student debt,[377] making public colleges and universities tuition-free by taxing financial transactions,[378] establishing a 32-hour work week,[379] and expanding Social Security benefits by eliminating the cap on the payroll tax on all incomes above $250,000.[380][381] He has become a prominent supporter of laws requiring companies to give their workers parental leave, sick leave, and vacation time, noting that such laws have been adopted by nearly all other developed countries.[382] He also supports legislation that would make it easier for workers to join or form a trade union.[383][384] He was against the Troubled Asset Relief Program[385] and has called for comprehensive financial reforms,[386] such as breaking up ""too big to fail"" financial institutions, restoring Glass–Steagall legislation, reforming the Federal Reserve Bank, and allowing the Post Office to offer basic financial services in economically marginalized communities.[387][388][389]

Believing greater emphasis is needed on labor rights and environmental concerns when negotiating international trade agreements, Sanders voted against and has long spoken against NAFTA, CAFTA, and PNTR with China. He has called them a ""disaster for the American worker"", saying that they have resulted in American corporations moving abroad. He also opposes the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which he says was ""written by corporate America and the pharmaceutical industry and Wall Street.""[390][391] On May 1, 2019, he tweeted: ""Since the China trade deal I voted against, America has lost over three million manufacturing jobs. It's wrong to pretend that China isn't one of our major economic competitors.""[392]

Sanders also strongly opposes outsourcing American jobs.[393] During discussions of the United States Innovation and Competition Act, which was to be used to fund the manufacture of semiconductors amid a shortage, he proposed a measure to ensure the companies the bill funded could not outsource their jobs. The proposed measure would also block the companies from forbidding their employees to unionize. Sanders's proposal was voted down by most Democrats and all Republicans in the Senate.[394][395] Ahead of the 2022 midterms, Sanders said he wants the Democratic Party to focus more on supporting unionization: ""I think we should move to a system where, if 50% of the workers in a bargaining unit plus one vote to form a union, they have a union. End of discussion.""[396]

Sanders supports establishing worker-owned cooperatives and introduced legislation numerous times from the 1990s to the 2020s that would aid workers who want to ""form their own businesses or to set up worker-owned cooperatives.""[397][398][399][400] As early as 1976, Sanders proposed workplace democracy, saying, ""I believe that, in the long run, major industries in this state and nation should be publicly owned and controlled by the workers themselves.""[401] Likewise, he supports empowering and expanding labor unions to advance union democracy.[402] In 1987, Sanders defined democracy as public ownership and workers' self-management in the workplace, saying: ""Democracy means public ownership of the major means of production, it means decentralization, it means involving people in their work. Rather than having bosses and workers it means having democratic control over the factories and shops to as great a degree as you can.""[403] In his 2020 run for president, he proposed that 20% of stocks in corporations with over $100 million in annual revenue be owned by the corporation's workers and that 45% of the board of directors of corporations with over $100 million in annual revenue be elected by the workers of that corporation.[404]

Foreign policy

Sanders supports reducing military spending while pursuing more diplomacy and international cooperation. He opposed funding Nicaraguan rebels, known as contras, in the CIA's covert war against Nicaragua's leftist government.[405] He opposed the U.S. invasion of Iraq and has criticized a number of policies instituted during the War on Terror, particularly that of mass surveillance and the USA Patriot Act.[406][407][408][409] He criticized Israel's actions during the 2014 Gaza war[410] and U.S. involvement in the Saudi Arabian-led intervention in Yemen.[411] On November 15, 2015, in response to the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL)'s attacks in Paris, he cautioned against Islamophobia and said, ""We gotta be tough, not stupid"" in the war against ISIL, adding that the U.S. should continue to welcome Syrian refugees.[412] He criticized the January 2020 drone assassination of Iranian general Qasem Soleimani, calling it a dangerous escalation of tensions that could lead to an expensive war.[413]

Sanders supports Palestinian rights and has criticized Israel on several occasions. In 2020, he called the American Israel Public Affairs Committee a platform for bigotry and said he would not attend its conference.[414] He condemned Trump's decision to recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital, saying, ""It would dramatically undermine the prospects for an Israeli–Palestinian peace agreement, and severely, perhaps irreparably, damage the United States' ability to broker that peace.""[415][416] During the 2023 Israel–Hamas war, he criticized Hamas for its attacks on civilians and criticized Israel for its bombing of Gaza. He first called for a pause in fighting, saying that he ""doesn't know if a ceasefire is possible with an organization like Hamas"",[417] but later called for a humanitarian ceasefire and urged Biden to withhold military aid to Israel.[418]

Addressing Westminster College in a September 2017 speech, Sanders laid out a foreign policy plan for greater international collaboration, adherence to U.S.-led international agreements such as the Paris Agreement and the Iran nuclear deal framework and promoting human rights and democratic ideals. He emphasized the consequences associated with global economic inequality and climate change and urged reining in the use of U.S. military power, saying it ""must always be a last resort"". He also criticized U.S. support for ""murderous regimes"" during the Cold War, such as those in Iran, Chile and El Salvador and said that those actions continue to make the U.S. less safe.[419][420] He also spoke critically of Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. elections and the way President Trump has handled the crisis.[421] He does not consider Turkey a U.S. ally and condemned the Turkish military offensive against U.S.-aligned Kurdish forces in northeastern Syria.[422]

Gun laws

Sanders supports closing the ""gun show loophole"", banning assault weapons, and passing and enforcing universal federal background checks for gun purchases.[423][424][425] In 1990, his bid to become a U.S. Representative benefitted from the National Rifle Association of America opposing the competing campaign of Peter Smith, who had reversed his stance on firearm restrictions, and waiting periods for handgun purchases.[426] In 1993, while a U.S. representative, he voted against the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act (which established background checks and wait periods), and in 2005 voted for legislation that gave gun manufacturers legal immunity against claims of negligence, but as of 2016 he has since said that he would support repealing that law.[124] In 1996, he voted against additional funding to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for research on issues related to firearms, but in 2016, he called for an increase in CDC funding for the study of gun violence.[124]

Social issues

On social issues, Sanders has long taken progressive stances.[427] He considers himself a feminist,[428] is pro-choice on abortion, and opposes defunding Planned Parenthood.[429] He has long advocated for LGBT rights; in 2009, he supported legalizing same-sex marriage in Vermont.[430] Sanders has denounced institutional racism and called for criminal justice reform to reduce the number of people in prison,[431] advocates a crackdown on police brutality, and supports abolishing private, for-profit prisons[432][433] and the death penalty.[434] He supports Black Lives Matter.[435] He also supports legalizing marijuana at the federal level.[436] He has advocated for greater democratic participation by citizens, campaign finance reform, and a constitutional amendment or judicial decision that would overturn Citizens United v. FEC.[437][438][439]

Trump administration

Sanders criticized President Trump for appointing multiple billionaires to his cabinet.[440] He criticized Trump's rolling back President Obama's Clean Power Plan, noting the scientifically reported effect on climate change of human activity and citing Trump's calling those reports a hoax.[441] He called for caution on the Syrian Civil War, saying, ""It's easier to get into a war than out of one.""[442][443] In 2017, he promised to defeat ""Trump and Trumpism and the Republican right-wing ideology"".[444]

Sanders gave an online reply to Trump's January 2018 State of the Union address in which he called Trump ""compulsively dishonest"" and criticized him for initiating ""a looming immigration crisis"" by ending the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program. He voiced concern about Trump's failure to mention the finding that Russia had interfered in the 2016 election and ""will likely interfere in the 2018 midterms we will be holding ... Unless you have a very special relationship with Mr. Putin.""[445]

On January 6, 2021, Trump supporters attacked the United States Capitol. Sanders commented: ""[Trump] has made it clear that he will do anything to remain in power – including insurrection and inciting violence [and he] will go down in history as the worst and most dangerous president in history.""[446]

Sanders voted to convict Trump on both articles of his first impeachment trial in 2020 (for pressuring a foreign leader to investigate Joe Biden), and again on the sole article of his second impeachment trial in 2021 (for inciting the Capitol attack).[447]

Biden administration

Sanders influenced the environmental policy goals of the Biden administration as described before Biden's nomination. Biden's policy team adopted certain details from the Biden-Sanders Unity Task Forces' climate recommendations.[448][449][450]

After Biden was elected president, Sanders became the subject of speculation over a potential appointment as Labor Secretary, which was supported by several progressive groups, such as the Sunrise Movement.[451] For his part, Sanders said that he would accept Biden's nomination if it was offered, but Boston mayor Marty Walsh was chosen for the position instead. When announcing Walsh's nomination, Biden confirmed that he had discussed the position with Sanders, but the two agreed that Sanders's resignation from the Senate and the ensuing special election would have put the Democrats' slim Senate majority at risk.[452]

On February 23, 2021, Sanders became the first senator in the Democratic caucus to oppose one of Biden's cabinet picks when he voted against Tom Vilsack's confirmation as Agriculture Secretary, citing concerns about Vilsack's past work as a lobbyist and ties to large corporations.[453]

Sanders strongly supported Senate Democrats' decision to use budget reconciliation, a procedure used to avoid filibusters, to pass the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021, despite having criticized Republicans' use of reconciliation to pass the 2017 tax cuts.[454] The bill passed the Senate by a 50–49 vote and was signed into law by Biden on March 11, 2021.[455]

Sanders has continued to have a strong influence on the Biden administration. When it was noted that he had become a key voice in Biden's administration, he replied, ""As somebody who wrote a book called Outsider in the House, yes, it is a strange experience to be having that kind of influence that we have now."" Their relationship has lasted over 30 years and Sanders has said it is based on respect and trust: ""We have had a good relationship. He wants to be a champion of working families, and I admire that and respect that.""[456]

Before the 2022 midterm election, Sanders said he regarded it as deciding the fate of democracy, abortion, and climate change, calling it ""the most consequential midterm election"" of modern U.S. history. He expressed a fear that the Democratic Party had ""not done a good enough job"" of getting its message out ""to young people and working-class people.""[457]

Sanders was the only independent or Democratic senator to oppose the CHIPS and Science Act, joining 17 Republican senators.[458] He called the bill ""crony capitalism"" and set several conditions for acceptance of the bill: ""Companies must agree to issue warrants or equity stakes to the federal government; they must commit to not buying back their own stock, outsourcing American jobs overseas or repealing existing collective bargaining agreements; and they must remain neutral in any union organizing efforts"".[459]

In April 2023, Sanders endorsed Biden in the 2024 United States presidential election,[460] and after Biden withdrew from the race, Sanders endorsed Harris for president at the Democratic National Convention.[461] Sanders attempted to appeal to pro-Palestinian critics of Harris by saying, ""I promise you, after Kamala wins, we will together do everything that we can to change US policy toward Netanyahu"", and emphasizing Donald Trump's policies on climate change, minimum wage, and tax cuts for the wealthy.[462] After Trump won the election, Sanders released a statement blaming the Democratic Party's abandonment of ""working-class people"" for its defeat.[463]

Party affiliations

Born into a Democratic-voting family, Sanders was first introduced to political activism when his brother Larry joined the Young Democrats of America and campaigned for Adlai Stevenson II in 1956.[464] Sanders joined Vermont's Liberty Union Party in 1971 and was a candidate for several offices, never coming close to winning election. He became party chairman,[465] but quit in 1977 to become an independent.[466] In 1980, he served as an elector for the Socialist Workers Party.[467][468] In 1981, Sanders ran as an independent for mayor of Burlington, Vermont, and defeated the Democratic incumbent; he was reelected three times.[80] Although an independent, he endorsed Democratic presidential candidates Walter Mondale in 1984 and Jesse Jackson in 1988. His endorsement of Mondale was lukewarm (telling reporters that ""if you go around saying that Mondale would be a great president, you would be a liar and a hypocrite""), but he supported Jackson enthusiastically.[469] The Washington Post reported that the Jackson campaign helped inspire Sanders to work more closely with the Democratic Party.[469][6]

Sanders attended the 1983 conference of the Socialist Party USA where he gave a speech.[470]

Sanders first ran for the U.S. House of Representatives in 1988 and for the U.S. Senate in 2006, each time adopting a strategy of winning the Democratic Party primary, thereby eliminating Democratic challengers, and then running as an independent in the general election.[471] He continued this strategy through his reelection in the 2018 United States Senate election in Vermont.[472] Throughout his tenure in Congress, he has been listed as an independent. He caucused with Democrats in the House[18] while refusing to join the party,[102] and continues to caucus with Democrats in the Senate.[205] Some conservative southern House Democrats initially barred him from the caucus as they believed that allowing a self-described socialist to join would harm their electoral prospects.[6] He soon came to work constructively with Democrats, voting with the party over 90% of the time during his tenure in Congress.[6]

Starting with his 2016 presidential campaign, Sanders's announcements suggested that not only was he running as a Democrat, but that he would run as a Democrat in future elections.[473][474][475] When challenged by Clinton about his party commitment, he said, ""Of course I am a Democrat and running for the Democratic nomination.""[476] Since he remained a senator elected as an independent, his U.S. Senate website and press materials continued to refer to him as an independent during the campaign and upon his return to the Senate.[477][478] In October 2017, Sanders said he would run for reelection as an independent in 2018 despite pressure to run as a Democrat.[479] His party status became ambiguous again in March 2019 when he signed a formal ""loyalty pledge"" to the Democratic Party stating that he was a member of the party and would serve as a Democrat if elected president. He signed the pledge the day after he signed paperwork to run as an independent for reelection to the Senate in 2024.[294]

After Trump's victory in the 2016 elections, Sanders suggested the Democratic Party undergo a series of reforms and that it ""break loose from its corporate establishment ties and, once again, become a grass-roots party of working people, the elderly and the poor.""[480] He drew parallels between his campaign and that of the Labour Party in the 2017 UK general election.[481][482] He wrote in The New York Times that ""the British elections should be a lesson for the Democratic Party"" and urged the Democrats to stop holding on to an ""overly cautious, centrist ideology"", arguing that ""momentum shifted to Labour after it released a very progressive manifesto that generated much enthusiasm among young people and workers.""[483][484] He had earlier praised Jeremy Corbyn's stance on class issues.[485] Sanders is one of two independents in the Senate, along with Angus King, both of whom caucus with the Democrats.[486]

Personal life

Sanders with his wife Jane O'Meara in Des Moines, Iowa, January 2016

In 1963, Sanders and Deborah Shiling Messing, whom he met in college, volunteered for several months on the Israeli kibbutz Sha'ar HaAmakim. They married in 1964 and bought a summer home in Vermont; they had no children and divorced in 1966.[30][487][488][18] His son (and only biological child), Levi Sanders, was born in 1969 to then-girlfriend Susan Campbell Mott.[28]

On May 28, 1988, Sanders married Jane O'Meara Driscoll (née Mary Jane O'Meara), who later became president of Burlington College, in Burlington, Vermont.[489] The day after their wedding, the couple visited the Soviet Union as part of an official delegation in his capacity as mayor.[490] They own a row house in Capitol Hill, a house in Burlington's New North End neighborhood, and a lakefront summer home in North Hero.[491][492][493][494] He considers Jane's three children—Dave Driscoll (born 1975), Carina Driscoll (born 1974), and Heather Titus (née Driscoll; 1971)—to be his own.[30][27]

Sanders's elder brother, Larry, lives in England;[495] he was a Green Party county councillor, representing the East Oxford division on Oxfordshire County Council, until he retired from the council in 2013.[496][497] Larry ran as a Green Party candidate for Oxford West and Abingdon in the 2015 British general election and came in fifth.[498][499] Bernie Sanders told CNN, ""I owe my brother an enormous amount. It was my brother who actually introduced me to a lot of my ideas.""[499]

Health

On October 1, 2019, Sanders was hospitalized after experiencing chest pains at a campaign event in Las Vegas. His campaign announced the next day that a blockage had been found in one coronary artery and two stents inserted.[500] Scheduled campaign events and appearances were canceled until further notice.[501] Two days later his campaign released a statement that he had been diagnosed with a heart attack. He was released from the hospital the same day.[500] The statement included the following from Sanders's doctors:[502]

After presenting to an outside facility with chest pain, Sen. Sanders was diagnosed with a myocardial infarction. He was immediately transferred to Desert Springs Hospital Medical Center. The senator was stable upon arrival and taken immediately to the cardiac catheterization laboratory, at which time two stents were placed in a blocked coronary artery in a timely fashion. All other arteries were normal. His hospital course was uneventful with good expected progress. He was discharged with instructions to follow up with his personal physician.

A few days after returning home, Sanders addressed media outside his home and said he had experienced fatigue and chest discomfort for a month or two before the incident; he expressed regret for not seeking medical assessment sooner: ""I was dumb.""[503]

Sanders made his first national appearance after his heart attack on October 15 at the Democratic debate, at which he said, ""I'm healthy, I'm feeling great."" When asked how he would reassure voters about his health and ability to take on the duties of the presidency, he said, ""We are going to be mounting a vigorous campaign all over this country. That is how I think I can reassure the American people."" It was noted that he was ""lively and sharp at the debate.""[504]

In December 2019, three months after the heart attack, Sanders released letters from three physicians, Attending Physician of Congress Brian P. Monahan and two cardiologists, who declared Sanders healthy and recovered from his heart condition.[505]

Honors and awards

On December 4, 2015, Sanders won Time's 2015 Person of the Year readers' poll with 10.2% of the vote[506][507] but did not receive the editorial board's award. On March 20, 2016, he was given an honorary Lushootseed name, dxʷshudičup,[e] by Deborah Parker in Seattle to honor his focus on Native American issues during his presidential campaign.[508]

On May 30, 2017, Sanders received an honorary degree of Doctor of Humane Letters from Brooklyn College.[509]

Religion, heritage, and values

As Sanders described his upbringing as an American Jew in a 2016 speech: his father generally attended synagogue only on Yom Kippur; he attended public schools while his mother ""chafed"" at his yeshiva Sunday schooling at a Hebrew school; and their religious observances were mostly limited to Passover seders with their neighbors. Larry Sanders said of their parents, ""They were very pleased to be Jews, but didn't have a strong belief in God.""[510] Bernie had a bar mitzvah[511] at the historic Kingsway Jewish Center in Midwood, Brooklyn, where he grew up.[510]

In 1963, in cooperation with the Labor Zionist youth movement Hashomer Hatzair, Sanders and his first wife volunteered at Sha'ar HaAmakim, a kibbutz in northern Israel.[512][513][514][19] His motivation for the trip was as much socialistic as it was Zionistic.[510]

As mayor of Burlington, Sanders allowed a Chabad public menorah to be placed at city hall, an action the ACLU contested. He publicly inaugurated the Hanukkah menorah and performed the Jewish religious ritual of blessing Hanukkah candles.[510] His early and strong support played a significant role in the now widespread public menorah celebrations around the globe.[515][516][517][518] When asked about his Jewish heritage, Sanders has said that he is ""proud to be Jewish.""[19]

Sanders rarely speaks about religion.[511] He describes himself as ""not particularly religious""[19] and ""not actively involved"" with organized religion.[511] A press package issued by his office states his religion as Jewish.[519] He has said he believes in God, but not necessarily in a traditional way: ""I think everyone believes in God in their own ways"", he said. ""To me, it means that all of us are connected, all of life is connected, and that we are all tied together.""[511][520] In October 2015, on the late-night talk show Jimmy Kimmel Live!, Kimmel asked him, ""You say you are culturally Jewish and you don't feel religious; do you believe in God and do you think that's important to the people of the United States?"" Sanders replied:[521]

I am who I am, and what I believe in and what my spirituality is about is that we're all in this together. That I think it is not a good thing to believe as human beings we can turn our backs on the suffering of other people ... and this is not Judaism, this is what Pope Francis is talking about, that we can't just worship billionaires and the making of more and more money. Life is more than that.

In 2016, he disclosed that he had ""very strong religious and spiritual feelings"", adding, ""My spirituality is that we are all in this together and that when children go hungry, when veterans sleep out on the street, it impacts me.""[522]

Sanders does not regularly attend synagogue, and he does not refrain from working on Rosh Hashanah, as observant Jews do. He has attended yahrzeit observances in memory of the deceased, for the father of a friend, and in 2015 attended a Tashlikh, an atonement ceremony, with the mayor of Lynchburg on the afternoon of Rosh Hashanah.[510] According to Richard Sugarman, his Jewish identity is ""certainly more ethnic and cultural than religious.""[523] His wife is Roman Catholic, and he has often expressed admiration for Pope Francis, saying that ""the leader of the Catholic Church is raising profound issues. It is important that we listen to what he has said."" He has said he feels very close to Francis's economic teachings, describing him as ""incredibly smart and brave"".[17][524][525] In April 2016, he accepted an invitation from Marcelo Sánchez Sorondo, an aide close to Francis, to speak at a Vatican conference on economic and environmental issues. While at the Vatican, he met briefly with Francis.[526][527]

In popular culture

In December 1987, during his tenure as mayor of Burlington, Sanders recorded a folk album, We Shall Overcome, with 30 Vermont musicians. As he was not a skilled singer, he performed his vocals in a talking blues style.[528][529]

Internet culture

Owing to his two high-profile campaigns in the 2016 and 2020 Democratic primaries, Sanders and his campaigns have generated many Internet memes and other online content. The Facebook group Bernie Sanders' Dank Meme Stash, where users can submit memes focused around Sanders, received significant attention in the 2016 primary season due to the at-the-time unique idea of a meme community focused entirely on a politician.[530][531] During the 2020 primary season, a still from a fundraising video in which Sanders tells the viewers ""I am once again asking for your financial support"" went viral online, with numerous edits made of the frame.[532][533] The day before Super Tuesday 2020, a video of the Twitch streamer Neekolul wearing a Bernie 2020 shirt and lip-syncing the song ""Oki Doki Boomer"" also went viral.[534] In 2021, a frame from the inauguration of Joe Biden showing Sanders seated in a folding chair wearing patterned mittens and a jacket reminiscent of the one in the ""I am once again asking"" meme went viral, with the image captioned or edited into other images, most commonly popular movie scenes.[535][536]

In film and television

Sanders appeared in a cameo role in the 1988 comedy-drama film Sweet Hearts Dance, playing a man who distributes candy to young trick-or-treaters.[537] In 1999, he acted in the film My X-Girlfriend's Wedding Reception, playing Rabbi Manny Shevitz. In this role, he mourned the Brooklyn Dodgers' move to Los Angeles, reflecting Sanders's own upbringing in Brooklyn.[538] On February 6, 2016, he was a guest star alongside Larry David (who is a sixth cousin once removed of Sanders) on Saturday Night Live, playing a Polish immigrant on a steamship that was sinking near the Statue of Liberty.[539][540]

In the DC Extended Universe film Birds of Prey (and the Fantabulous Emancipation of One Harley Quinn), one of the reasons Roman Sionis wants Harley Quinn dead is that she ""voted for Bernie"".[541]

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez ( oh-KAH-see-oh kor-TEZ, Spanish: [aleɣˈsandɾja oˈkasjo koɾˈtes]; born October 13, 1989), also known as AOC, is an American politician and activist serving since 2019 as the U.S. representative for New York's 14th congressional district. She is a member of the Democratic Party.

Ocasio-Cortez was born in the New York City borough of the Bronx. Her family later moved to Yorktown Heights for school. She attended Boston University, where she double-majored in international relations and economics, graduating with honors. She moved back to the Bronx, becoming an activist and working as a waitress and bartender.[4]

On June 26, 2018, Ocasio-Cortez drew national recognition when she won the Democratic Party's primary election for New York's 14th congressional district. She defeated Democratic Caucus chair Joe Crowley, a 10-term incumbent, in what was widely seen as the biggest upset victory in the 2018 midterm election primaries.[5][6][7] She easily won the November general election, defeating Republican Anthony Pappas. She was reelected in 2020, 2022, and 2024.

Taking office at age 29, Ocasio-Cortez is the youngest woman[8][9] and the first female member of the Democratic Socialists of America (DSA) to be elected to Congress, alongside Rashida Tlaib.[10][11] She advocates a progressive platform that includes support for worker cooperatives,[12] Medicare for All, tuition-free public colleges, a jobs guarantee, a Green New Deal, and abolishing the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). She is a prominent leader of the left-wing faction of the Democratic Party, and a member of progressive congressional bloc ""the Squad"".

Early life and education

Ocasio-Cortez was born in the New York City borough of the Bronx on October 13, 1989, the daughter of Sergio Ocasio-Roman and Blanca Ocasio-Cortez (née Cortez).[13] She has a younger brother named Gabriel.[14] Her father was born in the Bronx to a Puerto Rican family and became an architect; her mother was born in Puerto Rico.[15][16][17] The family lived in an apartment in the Bronx neighborhood of Parkchester[16] until Ocasio-Cortez was five, when they moved to a house in suburban Yorktown Heights.[16][18] She said her family raised enough money to buy a small home there so she could go to school, and that her mother worked as a house cleaner in the town.[19]

Ocasio-Cortez attended Yorktown High School, graduating in 2007.[20] In high school and college, Ocasio-Cortez went by the name of ""Sandy Ocasio"".[21] She came in second in the microbiology category of the Intel International Science and Engineering Fair in 2007 with a research project on the effect of antioxidants on the lifespan of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans.[22][23] In a show of appreciation for her efforts, the MIT Lincoln Laboratory named a small asteroid after her: 23238 Ocasio-Cortez.[24][25] In high school, she took part in the National Hispanic Institute's Lorenzo de Zavala (LDZ) Youth Legislative Session. After graduating, she became the LDZ Secretary of State while attending Boston University. Ocasio-Cortez had a John F. Lopez Fellowship.[26]

Her father died of lung cancer in 2008 during her second year of college,[27][28] and Ocasio-Cortez became involved in a lengthy probate dispute to settle his estate. She has said that the experience helped her learn ""first-hand how attorneys appointed by the court to administer an estate can enrich themselves at the expense of the families struggling to make sense of the bureaucracy"".[29] During college, Ocasio-Cortez was an intern for U.S. Senator Ted Kennedy in his section on foreign affairs and immigration issues.[30] In interviews, she said she was the only Spanish speaker in the office and the sole person responsible for assisting Spanish-speaking constituents.[30][31][32] Ocasio-Cortez graduated cum laude[33] from Boston University in 2011 with a bachelor's degree in international relations and economics.[34][31][35]

Early career

After college, Ocasio-Cortez moved back to the Bronx and took a job as a bartender and waitress to help her mother—a house cleaner and school bus driver—fight foreclosure of their home.[36][37] She later launched Brook Avenue Press, a now-defunct publishing firm for books that portrayed the Bronx in a positive light.[38][39] Ocasio-Cortez also worked for the nonprofit National Hispanic Institute.[26][40][41]

During the 2016 primary, Ocasio-Cortez worked as an organizer for Bernie Sanders's presidential campaign.[42] After the general election, she traveled across America by car, visiting places such as Flint, Michigan, and Standing Rock Indian Reservation in North Dakota, and speaking to people affected by the Flint water crisis and the Dakota Access Pipeline.[43] In an interview she recalled her December 2016 visit to Standing Rock as a tipping point, saying that before that, she had believed that the only way to run for office effectively was to have access to wealth, social influence, and power. But her visit to North Dakota, where she saw others ""putting their whole lives and everything that they had on the line for the protection of their community"", inspired her to begin to work for her own community.[44] One day after she visited North Dakota, she got a phone call from Brand New Congress, which was recruiting progressive candidates (her brother had nominated her soon after Election Day 2016).[45] Ocasio-Cortez said she was first exposed to the Democratic Socialists of America (DSA) when a friend brought her to a local meeting in Upper Manhattan, while it was picketing a camera company and calling attention to warehouse workers. She was impressed by the free childcare provided during the meeting. She has credited Jabari Brisport's unsuccessful City Council campaign with restoring her belief in electoral politics, in running as a socialist candidate, and in the DSA as an organization.[46]

Elections

2018

Ocasio-Cortez's congressional campaign logo was inspired by ""revolutionary posters and visuals from the past"". [ 47 ]

Ocasio-Cortez began her campaign in April 2017[8] while waiting tables and tending bar at Flats Fix, a taqueria in New York City's Union Square.[48] ""For 80 percent of this campaign, I operated out of a paper grocery bag hidden behind that bar,"" she told Bon Appétit.[49] She was the first person since 2004 to challenge Joe Crowley, the Democratic Caucus Chair, in the primary. She faced a financial disadvantage, saying, ""You can't really beat big money with more money. You have to beat them with a totally different game.""[50][51][29] Ocasio-Cortez's campaign undertook grassroots mobilization and did not take donations from corporations.[8] Her campaign posters' designs were said to have taken inspiration from ""revolutionary posters and visuals from the past"".[47]

The candidates' only face-to-face encounter during the campaign occurred on a local political talk show, Inside City Hall, on June 15. The format was a joint interview conducted by Errol Louis, which NY1 characterized as a debate.[52] A debate in the Bronx was scheduled for June 18, but Crowley did not participate. He sent former New York City Council member Annabel Palma in his place.[53][54][55]

Endorsements

Ocasio-Cortez was endorsed by progressive and civil rights organizations such as MoveOn[56] and Democracy for America.[42] Then-Governor Cuomo endorsed Crowley,[57] as did both of New York's U.S. senators, Chuck Schumer and Kirsten Gillibrand,[58] multiple U.S. representatives, various local elected officials and trade unions, and groups such as the Sierra Club,[59] Planned Parenthood,[59] the Working Families Party,[60] NARAL Pro-Choice America,[61] and Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America, among others.[62] California representative Ro Khanna, a Justice Democrat like Ocasio-Cortez,[58][8] initially endorsed Crowley but later endorsed Ocasio-Cortez in an unusual dual endorsement.[63]

Primary election

Results of the primary by precinct (Crowley in green, Ocasio-Cortez in blue)

Ocasio-Cortez received 57.13% of the vote (15,897) to Crowley's 42.5% (11,761), defeating the 10-term incumbent by almost 15 percentage points on June 26, 2018.[64] The result shocked many political commentators and analysts and immediately garnered nationwide attention. Many news sources, including Time, CNN, The New York Times, and The Guardian mentioned how the win completely defied their predictions and expectations.[42][65][66][6] She was outspent by a margin of 18 to 1 ($1.5 million to $83,000) but won the endorsement of some influential groups on the party's left.[67] Crowley conceded defeat on election night,[68] but did not telephone Ocasio-Cortez that night to congratulate her, fueling short-lived speculation that he intended to run against her in the general election.[69]

Bernie Sanders and Noam Chomsky congratulated her.[70][71] Several commentators noted the similarities between Ocasio-Cortez's victory over Crowley and Dave Brat's Tea Party movement-supported 2014 victory over House majority leader Eric Cantor in the Republican primary for Virginia's 7th congressional district.[72][73] Like Crowley, Cantor was a high-ranking member in his party's caucus.[74] After her primary win, Ocasio-Cortez endorsed several progressive primary challengers to Democratic incumbents nationwide,[75] capitalizing on her fame and spending her political capital in a manner unusual even[tone] for unexpected primary winners.[76]

Without campaigning for it, Ocasio-Cortez won the Reform Party primary as a write-in candidate in a neighboring congressional district, New York's 15th, with a total vote count of nine, highest among all 22 write-in candidates. She declined the nomination.[77][78]

General election

Ocasio-Cortez faced Republican nominee Anthony Pappas in the November 6 general election.[79] Pappas, an economics professor, did not actively campaign. The 14th district has a Cook Partisan Voting Index of D+29, making it New York City's sixth-most Democratic district, with registered Democrats outnumbering Republicans almost six to one.[80][81]

Ocasio-Cortez was endorsed by various politically progressive organizations and figures, including former president Barack Obama and U.S. senator Bernie Sanders.[82][83] She spoke at the Netroots Nation conference in August 2018, and was called ""the undisputed star of the convention"".[84]

Crowley remained on the ballot as the nominee of the Working Families Party (WFP) and the Women's Equality Party (WEP). Neither he nor the WFP party actively campaigned, both having endorsed Ocasio-Cortez after the Democratic primary.[85] Ocasio-Cortez called the WEP, which Governor Cuomo created ahead of the 2014 New York gubernatorial election, a cynical, centrist group that endorsed male incumbents over female challengers like her and Cynthia Nixon.[86] Former Connecticut senator Joe Lieberman, who won reelection in 2006 on a third-party line after losing the Democratic primary in 2006, penned a July 17 column in the Wall Street Journal expressing hope that Crowley would actively campaign on the WFP ballot line.[87] WFP Executive Director Dan Cantor wrote an endorsement of, and apology to, Ocasio-Cortez for the New York Daily News; he asked voters not to vote for Crowley if his name remained on the general election ballot.[88]

Ocasio-Cortez won the election with 78% of the vote (110,318) to Pappas's 14% (17,762). Crowley, on the WFP and WEP lines, received 9,348 votes (6.6%).[89] Her election was part of a broader Democratic victory in the 2018 midterm elections, as the party gained control of the House by picking up 41 seats.[90] Saikat Chakrabarti, who had been her campaign co-chair, became chief of staff for her congressional office.[91] His departure in 2019 drew considerable speculation as to whether Ocasio-Cortez was trying to implement a more moderate strategy.[92]

Media coverage

The first media network to give Ocasio-Cortez a platform and extensively cover her campaign and policies was The Young Turks, a left-wing online news program.[8] After her primary win, she quickly garnered nationwide media attention, including numerous articles and TV talk-show appearances.[93][94] She also drew a great amount of media attention when she and Sanders campaigned for James Thompson in Kansas in July 2018.[95] A rally in Wichita had to be moved from a theater with a capacity of 1,500 when far more people said they would attend. The event drew 4,000 people, with some seated on the floor.[96] In The New Yorker, Benjamin Wallace-Wells wrote that while Sanders remained ""the de-facto leader of an increasingly popular left, [he is unable to] do things that do not come naturally to him, like supply hope."" Wallace-Wells suggested that Ocasio-Cortez had made Sanders's task easier, as he could point to her success to show that ideas ""once considered to be radical are now part of the mainstream"".[96]

Until she defeated incumbent Joe Crowley in the 2018 Democratic primary, Ocasio-Cortez received little coverage on most traditional news media outlets.[97][98] Jimmy Dore interviewed her when she first announced her candidacy in June 2017.[99] After her primary win, Brian Stelter wrote that progressive-media outlets, such as The Young Turks and The Intercept, ""saw the Ocasio-Cortez upset coming"" in advance.[73] Margaret Sullivan wrote in The Washington Post that traditional metrics of measuring a campaign's viability, like total fundraising, were contributing to a ""media failure"" and that ""they need to get closer to what voters are thinking and feeling: their anger and resentment, their disenfranchisement from the centers of power, their pocketbook concerns.""[98]

Ocasio-Cortez's campaign was featured on the cover of the June 2018 edition of The Indypendent,[100][101] a free New York City-based monthly newspaper. In a tweet she hailed the cover appearance on ""NYC's classic monthly"" as an important breakthrough for her campaign.[102] Otherwise Ocasio-Cortez was barely mentioned in print until her primary win.[103]

Ocasio-Cortez was one of the subjects of the 2018 Michael Moore documentary Fahrenheit 11/9; it chronicled her primary campaign.[104][105]

In an attempt to embarrass Ocasio-Cortez just before she took office, Twitter user ""AnonymousQ"" shared a video dating to Ocasio-Cortez's college years: a Boston University student-produced dance video in which she briefly appeared.[106] Many social media users came to her defense, inspiring memes and a Twitter account syncing the footage to songs like ""Mambo No. 5"" and ""Gangnam Style"".[107] Ocasio-Cortez responded by posting a video of herself dancing to Edwin Starr's ""War"" outside her congressional office.[106]

Elizabeth Warren wrote the entry on Ocasio-Cortez for 2019's Time 100.[108] The documentary Knock Down the House, directed by Rachel Lears, which focuses on four female Democrats in the 2018 United States elections who were not career politicians—Ocasio-Cortez, Amy Vilela, Cori Bush and Paula Jean Swearengin—premiered at the 2019 Sundance Film Festival. Ocasio-Cortez was the only one of the women featured in the film to win.[109][110] It was released by Netflix on May 1, 2019.[111] Ocasio-Cortez also appeared in Lears's 2022 film To the End, which focuses on the effects of climate change. The film debuted at the 2022 Sundance Film Festival[112][113] and was presented at the Tribeca Film Festival in June 2022.[114]

2020

Michelle Caruso-Cabrera challenged Ocasio-Cortez in the 2020 Democratic primary.[115] After Ocasio-Cortez won the nomination, Caruso-Cabrera reorganized and ran in the general election as the Serve America Movement nominee.[116] Ocasio-Cortez's Republican challengers in the general election included nominee John Cummings, a former police officer, and Antoine Tucker, a write-in candidate.[116][117]

The American Prospect wrote in October 2020 that Ocasio-Cortez was ""spending the 2020 campaign running workshops"" for constituents on workplace organizing, fighting eviction, and organizing childcare.[118] They noted that Ocasio-Cortez was often not featured in the streamed workshops, saying the ""strategy decentralizes the candidate from her own campaign"".[118]

On October 20, 2020, Ocasio-Cortez hosted a Twitch stream of the social deduction game Among Us, with fellow congresswoman Ilhan Omar, and many established streamers such as Pokimane, Hasan Piker, DrLupo, and mxmtoon.[119] The stream peaked with over 400,000 viewers and, according to The Guardian's Joshua Rivera, succeeded in humanizing her.[120][121][122][123] Ocasio-Cortez again streamed Among Us on Twitch on November 27, 2020, with Hasan Piker, xQc, ContraPoints and Canadian MP Jagmeet Singh to raise money for food pantries, eviction defense legal aid, and community support organizations to assist those suffering economic hardship during the COVID-19 pandemic.[124] The stream raised $200,000 and Ocasio-Cortez wrote, ""This is going to make such a difference for those who need it most right now.""[125]

2022

Ocasio-Cortez ran unopposed in the Democratic primary.[126] She defeated Republican Tina Forte and Conservative Party nominee Desi Cuellar in the general election.[127]

2024

In May, the DSA debated whether to endorse Ocasio-Cortez. Some members argued that she was more committed to the Democratic Party and that her positions on Palestine had become weaker.[128] On June 23, the DSA National Political Committee (NPC) voted to endorse her so long as she fulfilled its list of demands, most concerning Palestine. The New York City chapter, which endorsed her, rejected the deal. On July 10, the NPC withdrew its endorsement of Ocasio-Cortez. It mainly cited a panel she held with Jewish leaders that supposedly conflated antisemitism with anti-Zionism. Other concerns included her support for a resolution that characterized denial of Israel's right to exist as antisemitism and her support of the Iron Dome defense system.[129][130][131]

Investment banker Marty Dolan, a moderate Democrat, ran against Ocasio-Cortez in the primary. Ocasio-Cortez won overwhelmingly.[132]

Ocasio-Cortez again easily won the general election against Forte.[133] Notably, some voters in her district split their tickets, voting for Ocasio-Cortez and for Trump in the presidential election.[134] Harris won 65% of the district's vote and Trump 33%, an increase from 2020. A political analyst said this was because both Trump and Ocasio-Cortez ""were leading with the message of working-class pocketbook issues"".[135] Ocasio-Cortez asked those who split their tickets why they did so; some said that they both cared about the working class and were ""less establishment"", while others cited the Israel-Hamas war and the economy.[136]

Tenure

Ocasio-Cortez's maiden speech as a Representative, addressing the 2018–2019 United States federal government shutdown

Taking office at age 29, Ocasio-Cortez is the youngest woman ever to serve in the United States Congress, and also the youngest member of the 116th Congress.[137]

When the 116th Congress convened on January 3, 2019, Ocasio-Cortez entered with no seniority but with a large social media presence. Axios credited her with ""as much social media clout as her fellow freshman Democrats combined"".[138] Since June 2024 , she has 13.1 million X (formerly Twitter) followers,[139] up from 1.4 million in November 2018.[138] As of January 2025, she has 8.4 million followers on Instagram[140] and 1.8 million on Facebook.[141] Ocasio-Cortez is also the most followed user on Bluesky, with 2 million followers as of March 2025.[142][143][144] Her colleagues appointed her to teach them social media lessons upon her arrival in Congress.[145] In July 2019, two lawsuits were filed against her for blocking Joey Salads and Dov Hikind on Twitter in light of the Second Circuit Court of Appeals ruling that it was a violation of the First Amendment for President Trump to block people on Twitter.[146][147] On November 4, 2019, it was announced that the lawsuit had been settled; Ocasio-Cortez issued an apology.[148][149]

In a 2019 interview, Ocasio-Cortez said she had stopped using her private Facebook account and was minimizing her usage of all social media accounts and platforms, calling them a ""public health risk"".[150][151]

Arrival

In November 2018, on the first day of congressional orientation, Ocasio-Cortez participated in a climate change protest outside the office of House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi.[152] Also that month, she backed Pelosi's bid to be Speaker of the House on the condition that Pelosi ""remains the most progressive candidate for speaker"".[153]

Ocasio-Cortez and Senator Bernie Sanders in December 2018

When Ocasio-Cortez made her first speech on the floor of Congress in January 2019, C-SPAN tweeted the video. Within 12 hours, the video of her speech set the record as C-SPAN's most-watched Twitter video of a member of the House of Representatives.[154]

Hearings

In February 2019, speaking at a Congressional hearing with a panel of representatives from campaign finance watchdog groups, Ocasio-Cortez questioned the panel about ethics regulations as they apply to both the president and members of Congress. She asserted that no regulations prevent lawmakers ""from being bought off by wealthy corporations"".[155] With more than 37.5 million views, the clip became the most-watched political video posted on Twitter.[156]

When President Donald Trump's former lawyer Michael Cohen appeared before the Oversight Committee in February 2019, Ocasio-Cortez asked him whether Trump had inflated property values for bank or insurance purposes.[157] Cohen's reply implied that Trump may have committed tax and bank fraud.[158][159] The president of the American Constitution Society named Ocasio-Cortez as the committee member best at obtaining specific information from Cohen about Trump's ""shady practices, along with a road map for how to find out more"".[160] New York Times columnist David Brooks praised her skill in questioning Cohen.[161] The exchange between Ocasio-Cortez and Cohen prompted an investigation by New York attorney general Letitia James, who referred to it in August 2020 when filing legal action to compel Trump's companies to comply with subpoenas about financial information, and to compel his son Eric Trump to testify.[162] Further developments as a result of the exchange saw James form a civil investigation and lawsuit against the Trump Organization regarding potential financial fraud, which resulted in a fine of $354 million and a ban on Trump doing business in New York for two to three years.[163][164][165]

Media coverage

According to reports in March 2019, Ocasio-Cortez continued to receive media coverage early in her congressional tenure on par with that of 2020 presidential candidates[166] and was considered ""one of the faces of the Democratic party""[167] and one of the most talked-about politicians in the United States.[168] Between July 8 and 14, 2019, she drew more social media attention than the Democratic presidential candidates. Tracking company NewsWhip found that interactions with news articles on Ocasio-Cortez numbered 4.8 million, while no Democratic presidential candidate got more than 1.2 million. David Bauder of the Associated Press wrote that Trump's supporters were thus having ""some success"" in having ""Ocasio-Cortez be top of mind when people think of"" the Democratic Party.[169]

According to a Media Matters for America study, Ocasio-Cortez was intensely discussed on sister television channels Fox News and Fox Business, being mentioned every day from February 25 to April 7, 2019, for a total of 3,181 mentions in 42 days. The Guardian's David Smith wrote that this is evidence that Fox is ""obsessed by Ocasio-Cortez, portraying her as a radical socialist who threatens the American way of life"".[170] Brian Stelter of CNN Business found that between January and July 2019, she had nearly three times as many mentions on Fox News as on CNN and MSNBC. Stelter wrote that the attention Ocasio-Cortez is receiving has caused ""the perception, particularly on the right, that her positions and policies are representative of the Democratic Party as a whole"".[171] In March 2019, Time Magazine said Ocasio-Cortez was the ""second-most talked about politician"" in the United States, after Trump, and called her ""the Wonder Woman of the left"".[172]

In March 2019, PolitiFact reported that Ocasio-Cortez is ""one of the most targeted politicians for hoax claims, despite the fact that she just entered Congress as a freshman"". Fake quotes attributed to her, fake photos of her, and false rumors about her have spread on social media. Some of these have originated from 4chan and r/The_Donald.[173] By July 2019, the fake material included attributing things Trump said to Ocasio-Cortez, such as ""I have a very good brain and I've said lots of things.""[174] On July 18, 2019, Charlie Rispoli, a police officer from Gretna, Louisiana, posted on Facebook an apparent threat to shoot Ocasio-Cortez, calling her a ""vile idiot"" who ""needs a round, and I don't mean the kind she used to serve"" as a bartender. Rispoli posted the comment in response to a fake news article that falsely quoted Ocasio-Cortez as saying, ""We pay soldiers too much"".[175] Rispoli was fired for his post and his Facebook account was deleted.[176]

Ocasio-Cortez is known to wear red lipstick, usually by the American makeup brand Stila Cosmetics in the shade ""Beso"", as a style trait of Latina women from the Bronx.[177] In a skincare tutorial for Vogue, she explained that beauty and femininity are important to her because these things are often used against women in politics and society, and that self-love is like a ""mini protest"" against misogynistic critiques.[178]

Met Gala appearance

Ocasio-Cortez attended the 2021 Met Gala, which had the theme ""In America: a Lexicon of Fashion"". The Met Gala is an annual fundraiser for the Metropolitan Museum of Art that is overseen by Vogue editor-in-chief Anna Wintour, who selects every invitee and designer pairing. Ocasio-Cortez wore an organza gown emblazoned with the phrase ""Tax the Rich"". As an elected official in New York City, she was considered a guest of the museum, and as such did not have to buy a ticket, which costs persons other than elected officials at least $35,000. In response, Ocasio-Cortez said her critics were using a sexist double standard and that she ""punctured the fourth wall of excess and spectacle"". Designer Aurora James also said the extremely wealthy people in attendance needed to see the message in person.[179]

In September 2021, the American Accountability Foundation filed an ethics complaint against Ocasio-Cortez for attending the Met Gala. The AAF claimed that her attendance amounted to accepting an illegal gift since her estimated $35,000 ticket was paid for by Condé Nast, a for-profit company, not a charity.[180][181][182]

""The Squad""

Ocasio-Cortez is a member of an informal group of progressive members of Congress called ""the Squad"", initially including Ilhan Omar, Ayanna Pressley, and Rashida Tlaib.[183] On July 14, 2019, Trump attacked the Squad (which had only four members at the time) in a tweet, saying that they should ""go back and help fix"" the countries they came from rather than criticize the American government.[184] He continued to make similar comments over the next several days, even though three of the women, including Ocasio-Cortez, were born in the United States. Ocasio-Cortez responded in a tweet that ""the President's words [yesterday], telling four American Congresswomen of color 'go back to your own country' is hallmark language of white supremacists.""[185] She later added, ""We don't leave the things that we love, and when we love this country, what that means is that we propose the solutions to fix it.""[186] Days later, Trump falsely asserted that Ocasio-Cortez called ""our country and our people 'garbage'""; she had actually said that Americans should not be content with moderate policies that are ""10% better from garbage"".[187] Trump also falsely claimed that Ocasio-Cortez said ""illegal immigrants are more American"" than Americans who tried to keep them out; she actually said that ""women and children on that border that are trying to seek refuge and opportunity"" in America ""are acting more American"" than those who tried to keep them out.[188] The Squad grew in 2020, 2022, and 2024, with Jamaal Bowman, Cori Bush, Greg Casar, Summer Lee, and Delia Ramirez joining.[189]

Green New Deal

H. Res. 109: ""Recognizing the duty of the Federal Government to create a Green New Deal""; the first piece of legislation authored by Ocasio-Cortez.

Ocasio-Cortez submitted her first piece of legislation, the Green New Deal, to the House on February 7, 2019. She and Senator Ed Markey released a joint non-binding resolution laying out the main elements of a 10-year ""economic mobilization"" that ""would phase out fossil fuel use and overhaul the nation's infrastructure.""[190] Their plan called for implementing the ""social cost of carbon"" that was part of the Obama administration's plans to address climate change. In the process it aimed to create jobs.[190] According to CNBC, an initial outline the Green New Deal called for ""completely ditching fossil fuels, upgrading or replacing 'every building' in the country and 'totally overhaul[ing] transportation' to the point where 'air travel stops becoming necessary'"". The outline set a goal of having the U.S. ""creating 'net zero' greenhouse gases in 10 years. Why 'net zero'? The lawmakers explained: 'We set a goal to get to net-zero, rather than zero emissions, in 10 years because we aren't sure that we'll be able to fully get rid of farting cows and airplanes that fast.'""[191] Activist groups such as Greenpeace and the Sunrise Movement came out in favor of the plan. No Republican lawmakers voiced support.[192][193] The plan gained support from some Democratic senators, including Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders and Cory Booker;[194] other Democrats, such as Senator Dianne Feinstein and House speaker Nancy Pelosi, dismissed the proposal (Pelosi has referred to it as ""the green dream, or whatever they call it"").[195]

On March 26, Senate Republicans called for an early vote on the Green New Deal without allowing discussion or expert testimony. Markey said Republicans were trying to ""make a mockery"" of the Green New Deal debate and called the vote a ""sham"". In protest, Senate Democrats voted ""present"" or against the bill, resulting in a 57–0 defeat on the Senate floor.[196][197]

In March 2019, a group of UK activists proposed that the Labour Party adopt a similar plan, ""Labour for a Green New Deal"". The group said it was inspired by the Sunrise Movement and the work Ocasio-Cortez has done in the US.[198]

Harassment

On July 20, 2020, U.S. Representatives Ted Yoho and Roger Williams accosted Ocasio-Cortez on the Capitol steps, where Yoho (as overheard by a journalist) called her ""disgusting"" and told her ""You are out of your freaking mind"" for recently suggesting that poverty and unemployment were driving a spike in crime in New York City during the COVID-19 pandemic amid her ongoing advocacy for cutting police budgets. Ocasio-Cortez told Yoho he was being ""rude"". As she walked away from Yoho into the Capitol, Yoho called her a ""fucking bitch"".[199][200] Yoho addressed the matter on the House floor and, without naming Ocasio-Cortez, apologized for the ""abrupt manner of the conversation"" with her, claiming that ""offensive name calling, words attributed to me by the press, were never spoken to my colleagues"", and concluding: ""I cannot apologize for my passion"".[201][202] Ocasio-Cortez responded with a speech saying that the incident was emblematic of a ""culture ... accepting of violence and violent language against women ... In using that language, in front of the press, he gave permission to use that language against his wife, his daughters, women in his community, and I am here to stand up to say that is not acceptable.""[203][204]

In November 2021, Representative Paul Gosar posted a version of the title sequence of the anime series Attack on Titan on social media that he had edited with the faces of Ocasio-Cortez, Joe Biden, and himself superimposed on the show's characters, depicting Gosar attacking them with swords and killing Ocasio-Cortez. Speaker Nancy Pelosi called for law enforcement and the House Ethics Committee to investigate it as a threat.[205] Pelosi opened discussion on the House floor, saying that Gosar's actions demanded a response: ""We cannot have members joking about murdering each other or threatening the president of the United States. This is both an indictment of our elected officials and an insult to the institution of the House of Representatives. It's not just about us as members of Congress. It is a danger that it represents to everyone in the country.""[206] When Republican House members refused to condemn the video, Ocasio-Cortez responded that she believed the video was ""part of a pattern that normalizes violence"", adding, ""I believe this is a part of a concerted strategy and I think it's very important for us to draw a strict line a strong line for material consequence"". She gave a six-minute floor speech, saying, ""This is not about me. This is not about Representative Gosar. This is about what we're willing to accept."" The House voted to censure Gosar, mostly along party lines. The last time the House censured a lawmaker was in 2010.[207][208]

January 6 Capitol attack

In a nearly 90-minute Instagram Live video made in February 2021,[209] Ocasio-Cortez said that she had previously experienced sexual assault, and recounted her experience of fear during the 2021 storming of the United States Capitol, when she was in her office (in the Cannon House Office Building).[210] She said she had hidden in her office bathroom before being startled by a Capitol Police officer who entered her office suite and shouted ""Where is she?"" before ordering her and her staff to evacuate to a different House Office Building. Ocasio-Cortez said the officer did not self-identify, and said she first believed the officer's voice was that of an attacker. She described sheltering in place in Representative Katie Porter's office and preparing for what she believed would be an assault by rioters on their offices.[211][212] She said, ""I had a very close encounter where I thought I was going to die.""[213]

2024 Democratic National Convention speech

Ocasio-Cortez gave her first major convention speech at the 2024 Democratic National Convention, where she was given a primetime slot.[214] She expressed support for the Harris-Walz campaign and heavily criticized Trump, calling him a union buster who would ""sell this country for a dollar if it meant lining his own pockets and greasing the palms of his Wall Street friends"". She leaned into her middle-class background and said that Harris would support the middle class because she is from it and understands it. Ocasio-Cortez also addressed the Gaza war, saying Harris was ""working tirelessly"" for a ceasefire and hostage deal.[215]

The speech was well received, including by moderate and establishment Democrats. After the speech, Politico wrote that Ocasio-Cortez was one of the party's ""most celebrated stars"" and that the establishment acknowledged it.[216][217] The speech also led to speculation as to whether Ocasio-Cortez would run for higher office.[218][216][219][220]

Other issues

Ocasio-Cortez looks on as President Joe Biden speaks about the administration's response to Hurricane Ida on September 7, 2021

Ocasio-Cortez reacted to the 2021 Texas power crisis by organizing a fundraiser to provide food, water, and shelter to affected Texans. The fundraiser, which began on February 18, raised $2 million in its first day[221][222] and $5 million by February 21.[223] The money was given to organizations such as the Houston Food Bank and the North Texas Food Bank.[223] Ocasio-Cortez also traveled to Houston to help volunteers with recovery.[224]

On April 15, 2021, Ocasio-Cortez and three members of Congress called a press conference to announce a bill that they had introduced to implement postal banking pilot programs in rural and low-income urban neighborhoods where millions of households cannot access or afford standard banking services. Ocasio-Cortez described the families she sees in her urban community who need to rely on check cashing companies that charge exorbitant interest rates due to the absence of mainstream banks. ""They'll show up to a check cashing place and imagine cashing your stimulus check...and having 10 to 20% of that check taken away from you.""[225]

On November 5, 2021, Ocasio-Cortez was one of six House Democrats to break with their party and vote against the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, as it was decoupled from the social safety net provisions in the Build Back Better Act.[226][227]

In September 2022, Ocasio-Cortez was asked about running for president. She said, ""I hold two contradictory things [in mind] at the same time. One is just the relentless belief that anything is possible. But at the same time, my experience here has given me a front-row seat to how deeply and unconsciously, as well as consciously, so many people in this country hate women. And they hate women of color. People ask me questions about the future. And realistically, I can't even tell you if I'm going to be alive in September [of 2022]. And that weighs very heavily on me. And it's not just the right wing. Misogyny transcends political ideology: left, right, center.""[228]

In June 2024, following reports that Clarence Thomas accepted undisclosed gifts from conservatives, Ocasio-Cortez said the Court was ""corrupted by money and extremism"" and undemocratic. She and Representative Jamie Raskin led a congressional meeting about the Court,[229] and explored options for holding justices accountable.[230] On June 25, they introduced the ""High Court Gift Ban Act"", which would impose restrictions on the gifts given to justices.[231]

In July 2024, Ocasio-Cortez supported and co-led the ""DEFIANCE Act"", which would allow people to sue creators and distributors of non-consensual deepfake pornography of themselves, something that had previously been done to her.[232]

Ocasio-Cortez introducing articles of impeachment for Samuel Alito and Clarence Thomas in 2024

On July 1, after the Supreme Court ruled in Trump v. United States that presidents have immunity from criminal prosecution for official actions, Ocasio-Cortez announced she would file articles of impeachment against justices. She said the court was corrupt and that Congress must defend the nation against an ""authoritarian capture"".[233][234] On July 10, Ocasio-Cortez officially introduced articles of impeachment against Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito, co-sponsored by seven House Democrats. The resolution accused the justices of failing to recuse themselves from cases despite personal bias and not disclosing lavish gifts they received. The resolution cited the involvement of Ginni Thomas in attempts to overturn the 2020 election and the presence of ""Stop the Steal"" symbols on Alito's properties as personal bias.[235] In a statement, she said that corruption in the court had become a constitutional crisis that threatened democracy.[236][237] Legal experts said the case would likely fail, but was still important because it drew attention to the justices' conduct.[238]

In December 2024, Ocasio-Cortez made a bid for ranking member of the House Oversight Committee, but lost to the more senior Gerry Connolly.[239]

Committee assignments

Caucus memberships

Political positions

Ocasio-Cortez has been described as progressive,[244] left-wing,[245] left-wing populist,[246] and far-left.[247]

Ocasio-Cortez is a member of the Democratic Socialists of America[10] and embraces the democratic socialist label as part of her political identity. In an interview on NBC's Meet the Press, she described democratic socialism as ""part of what I am. It's not all of what I am. And I think that that's a very important distinction.""[248] In response to a question about democratic socialism ultimately calling for an end to capitalism during a Firing Line interview on PBS, she answered: ""Ultimately, we are marching towards progress on this issue. I do think that we are going to see an evolution in our economic system of an unprecedented degree, and it's hard to say what direction that that takes.""[249] Later at a conference she said ""To me, capitalism is irredeemable.""[250]

Ocasio-Cortez supports progressive ideals such as workplace democracy,[12] single-payer Medicare for All, tuition-free public college and trade school,[251] a federal job guarantee,[252] the cancellation of all $1.6 trillion of outstanding student debt,[253] guaranteed family leave,[254] abolishing U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement,[255] ending the privatization of prisons, enacting gun-control policies,[256] and energy policy relying on 100% renewables.[257] She told Anderson Cooper that she favors policies that ""most closely resemble what we see in the UK, in Norway, in Finland, in Sweden"".[258]

Economic policy

Ocasio-Cortez has rejected state socialism, calling it ""undemocratic"" and ""easily corrupted"", but has expressed support for worker control of the means of production.[259] She has also said that market economies are not incompatible with democratic socialism as long as workers control companies, citing worker cooperatives as a model.[260]

Ocasio-Cortez supports raising the marginal tax rate on top income earners to fund the implementation of her policy goals.[261] She was among the 46 House Democrats who voted against final passage of the Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023.[262] Ocasio-Cortez has called for reducing defense spending.[263] In December 2022, she was the only House Democrat to vote against an omnibus spending package because it increased funding for defense and federal agencies that oversee immigration.[264]

In late 2020, Ocasio-Cortez and Rashida Tlaib proposed a public banking bill to encourage creation of state and local public banks by giving them access to facilities from the Federal Reserve and setting national guidelines on public banking.[265] In April 2021, Ocasio-Cortez announced a bill that she and three senators had introduced to implement postal banking pilot programs in rural and low-income urban neighborhoods where millions of households cannot access or afford standard banking services.[225]

Ocasio-Cortez has been a vocal supporter of labor rights, including a $15 per hour federal minimum wage.[266] In May 2019, she returned to bartending at the Queensboro Restaurant in Jackson Heights, Queens, to promote the Raise the Wage Act, which would increase the minimum hourly wage for restaurant servers and other tipped workers from $2.13 to $15. Speaking to restaurant workers, customers and reporters, she criticized an exemption in U.S. minimum wage law for restaurants and the service sector that allows them to be paid less than $7.25 per hour, saying, ""Any job that pays $2.13 per hour is not a job, it is indentured servitude.""[267][268] On January 20, 2021, Ocasio-Cortez skipped the inauguration of Joe Biden in order to join the 2021 Hunts Point Produce Market strike in the Bronx.[269]

Ocasio-Cortez and Bernie Sanders in 2019

In September 2019, Ocasio-Cortez introduced an anti-poverty policy proposal (packaged in a bundle called ""A Just Society"") that would take into account the cost of childcare, health care, and ""new necessities"" like Internet access when measuring poverty. The proposal would cap annual rent increases and ensure access to social welfare programs for people with convictions and undocumented immigrants.[270] According to the U.S. census, about 40 million Americans live in poverty.

Ocasio-Cortez has proposed a marginal tax as high as 70% on income above $10 million to pay for the Green New Deal. According to tax experts contacted by The Washington Post, this tax would bring in extra revenue of $720 billion per decade.[271][272] But an analysis by the think tank Tax Foundation estimated that, after accounting for macroeconomic effects, the proposal would increase tax revenue by $189.1 billion over ten years if it is applied only to ordinary income, or decrease tax revenue by 53.1 billion if it is applied to all forms of income, including capital gains.[273] Ocasio-Cortez has opposed and voted against the pay-as-you-go rule supported by Democratic leaders, which requires deficit-neutral fiscal policy, with all new expenditures balanced by tax increases or spending cuts. She and Representative Ro Khanna have condemned the rule for hamstringing new or expanded progressive policies.[274][275] Drawing a parallel with the Great Depression, she has argued that the Green New Deal needs deficit spending like the original New Deal.[276]

Ocasio-Cortez opposed a planned deal by New York City to give Amazon.com $3 billion in state and city subsidies and tax breaks to build a secondary headquarters (Amazon HQ2) that was expected to bring in $27 billion in tax revenue for the city and state, in an area near her congressional district, saying that the city should instead itself invest $3 billion in the district.[277][278][279] Conservative columnist Marc Thiessen argued that ""New York does not have $3 billion in cash"" it would ""give"" to Amazon, and that between 25,000 and 40,000 new jobs, in addition to the high-paying tech jobs Amazon would have created, disappeared when Amazon left and ""her economic illiteracy is dangerous"" because ""by helping to drive Amazon away, she did not save New York $3 billion; she cost New York $27 billion.""[280] She ""boasted"" that she was right after Amazon ceased its construction of the HQ2 project in Virginia, which it chose over New York.[281] The progressive think tank Data for Progress wrote that New York taxpayers ""would be subsidizing Amazon's activities in the city by surrendering $3 billion in would-be tax revenue"", that there were ""enormous hidden costs associated with Amazon's residence"" and that ""the argument that the city would not literally pay cash to Amazon is superficial and semantic"". Data for Progress also noted that Amazon instead announced it would bring 1,500 jobs to New York without a tax break.[281][282] Former New York Mayor Mike Bloomberg also opposed the tax breaks.[283]

In 2024, Ocasio-Cortez took part in a live-streamed roundtable with Federal Trade Commission Chair Lina Khan, discussing ""efforts to check unlawful corporate power"".[284] Later, in response to investor and Harris supporter Mark Cuban saying that he wouldn't keep Khan, Ocasio-Cortez said ""anyone goes near Lina Khan and there will be an out and out brawl"".[285]

Environment

Ocasio-Cortez speaks on a Green New Deal in front of the Capitol Building in February 2019.

Ocasio-Cortez has called for ""more environmental hardliners in Congress"",[276] calling climate change ""the single biggest national security threat for the United States and the single biggest threat to worldwide industrialized civilization"".[286] Referring to a recent United Nations report indicating that the effects of climate change could become irreversible unless carbon emissions are reined in within the next 12 years, she has argued that global warming must be addressed immediately to avert human extinction.[287][288][289]

Ocasio-Cortez's environmental plan, the Green New Deal, advocates for the U.S. to transition to an electrical grid running on 100% renewable energy[194] and to end the use of fossil fuels within ten years. The changes, estimated to cost roughly $2.5 trillion per year, would be financed in part by higher taxes on the wealthy.[290][291][292] She has said she has an ""open mind"" about nuclear power's role in the Green New Deal,[293] but has been criticized for ignoring it in her proposals for the deal.[294][295]

In 2024, Ocasio-Cortez, supported by Bowman and Sanders, introduced the ""Green New Deal for Public Housing"", a plan to fund the New York City Housing Authority (NYCHA) and help it transition to clean energy.[296]

Foreign policy

China

Ocasio-Cortez criticized the American companies Activision Blizzard and Apple for censoring pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong.[297] She co-signed a letter to Activision Blizzard CEO Bobby Kotick that read, ""As China amplifies its campaign of intimidation, you and your company must decide whether to look beyond the bottom line and promote American values—like freedom of speech and thought—or to give in to Beijing's demands in order to preserve market access.""[298]

A bipartisan letter by Ocasio-Cortez and seven other lawmakers fiercely criticized the NBA's handling of a controversy involving a tweet by Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey supporting pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong. The lawmakers wrote that the NBA's response not only ""sold out an American citizen"" but also ""reinforces the Chinese Communist Party view that those who point to Chinese repression in Hong Kong are as best stating opinions, not facts"", as well as being ""a betrayal of fundamental American values"".[299][300][301]

Middle East

Ocasio-Cortez voted to withdraw U.S. military aid for Saudi Arabia's intervention in Yemen,[302] and was among 56 Democrats to vote in favor of H.Con.Res. 21, which directed President Joe Biden to remove U.S. troops from Syria within 180 days.[303][304]

Ocasio-Cortez criticized President Trump's administration for escalating tensions with Iran, saying that it would bring the country into a ""military conflict that is completely irresponsible"".[305]

Ocasio-Cortez supported the Mahsa Amini protests, saying, ""right to choose belongs to us all, from hijabs to reproductive care"". This was criticized by the conservative Washington Examiner, which said that Iranian repression was not comparable to abortion restrictions.[306]

Israel-Palestine

In May 2018, Ocasio-Cortez criticized the Israel Defense Forces' use of deadly force against Palestinians participating in the 2018 Gaza border protests, calling it a ""massacre"" in a tweet.[307][308] In a July 2018 interview, she said she was ""a proponent of a two-state solution""[249] and called Israel's presence in the West Bank an ""occupation of Palestine"". After being asked to elaborate, she responded she was not ""the expert on geopolitics on this issue"".[309][310] Her use of the term ""occupation"" drew backlash from a number of pro-Israel groups and commentators.[311][309] Others defended her remarks, citing the United Nations' designation of the territory in the West Bank as occupied.[312][313] In July 2019, Ocasio-Cortez voted against a House resolution introduced by Representative Brad Schneider condemning the Global Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions Movement targeting Israel.[314] The resolution passed 398–17.[315]

Ocasio-Cortez warned that Israel's planned annexation of Palestinian territories in the occupied West Bank ""would lay the groundwork for Israel becoming an apartheid state"".[316] She wrote to U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo that she would work to ""pursue legislation that conditions the $3.8 billion in U.S. military funding to Israel to ensure that U.S. taxpayers are not supporting annexation in any way"".[316] AIPAC condemned the letter, saying it threatened the U.S.-Israel relationship.[317]

In May 2021, Ocasio-Cortez issued a statement condemning Israel's evictions of Palestinian families from their homes in Israeli-occupied East Jerusalem.[318] She criticized President Biden for saying Israel ""has a right to defend itself"", arguing that ""blanket statements like these [with] little context or acknowledgement of what precipitated this cycle of violence—namely, the expulsions of Palestinians and attacks on Al Aqsa—dehumanize Palestinians [and] imply the US will look the other way at human rights violations.""[319]

On September 23, 2021, Ocasio-Cortez abruptly changed her vote from ""no"" to ""present"" on a bill providing $1 billion for Israel's Iron Dome missile defense system, citing the ""hateful targeting"" she had received surrounding the bill. She apologized for her vote after receiving criticism on social media from some supporters of Israel and of Palestine but maintained her opposition to the bill due to Israel's ""persistent human rights abuses against the Palestinian people"".[320]

On July 18, 2023, Ocasio-Cortez and eight other progressive Democrats (Jamaal Bowman, Cori Bush, Andre Carson, Summer Lee, Ilhan Omar, Ayanna Pressley, Delia Ramirez, and Rashida Tlaib), voted against a congressional non-binding resolution proposed by August Pfluger that ""the State of Israel is not a racist or apartheid state"", that Congress rejects ""all forms of antisemitism and xenophobia"", and that ""the United States will always be a staunch partner and supporter of Israel"". She argued that it was wrong to pair ""accusations of antisemitism with real concerns around the human rights crisis in the region"" and that combining a ""vote on antisemitism and discussion of apartheid and...two-tier legal systems is very cynical"".[321]

In 2023, Ocasio-Cortez condemned the October 7 attacks, calling them ""horrifying attacks against innocent civilians"".[322] On October 12, she criticized Israel's plans to block electricity, water and fuel from Gaza, calling it a ""collective punishment and a violation of international law"".[323] On October 16, she signed a resolution calling for a ceasefire in the war.[324] On March 22, 2024, she characterized Israel's assault on Gaza and the Gaza Strip famine as genocide.[325]

Asked what the Biden administration could have done better in the situation, Ocasio-Cortez said it could have enforced its red line on the Rafah offensive, investigated its weapons shipments to Israel, provided heavier sanctions in response to the occupation of the West Bank, and ""rein in"" Netanyahu.[326] In a separate statement, she called for halting weapons transfers to Israel.[327]

In January 2024, the U.S. and other countries cut funding to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) over intelligence reports that certain staff members participated in the Hamas attacks.[328] On January 29, Ocasio-Cortez acknowledged the reports, but said that cutting funding to UNRWA was ""unacceptable"" and that the U.S. ""should restore aid immediately"" because of the agency's humanitarian work.[329]

Ocasio-Cortez boycotted Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's 2024 speech to Congress, calling him a war criminal.[330]

On September 18, 2024, Ocasio-Cortez condemned Israel for the 2024 Lebanon pager explosions.[331]

Governance

Judiciary

After the contentious confirmation of Supreme Court Justice Amy Coney Barrett, Ocasio-Cortez urged Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden to expand the court if he won and their party achieved a Senate majority.[332] In April 2021, she supported a bill to increase the Court's size.[333] She again called for expansion in September 2021 after the Court voted not to grant an emergency stay of the Texas Heartbeat Bill.[334]

In March 2022, Ocasio-Cortez called on Justice Clarence Thomas to resign over his wife's texts urging President Trump's chief of staff to overturn the 2020 presidential election, raising a possible impeachment effort if he did not.[335] After the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in June 2022, Ocasio-Cortez called for the impeachment of Justices Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh. She alleged that the two had lied under oath about their views on Roe during their confirmation hearings.[336]

In June 2022, after the Supreme Court made several consequential rulings and granted certiorari to Moore v. Harper, which has a potential impact on future elections, Ocasio-Cortez tweeted that the U.S. was ""witnessing a judicial coup in progress"".[337][338] The next month, she claimed the Court had ""gone rogue"" and that impeachment, expansion, introduction of ethics rules and recusal requirements should be considered. She added that Thomas should certainly be impeached.[339] Two days later, she led House progressives calling on the Democratic leadership in Congress to strip the Court of its jurisdiction ""in the areas of abortion, marriage equality, non-procreative intimacy, and contraception"". They pointed to Thomas' concurring opinion in Dobbs, which suggested revisiting cases that established a constitutional right to contraception, same-sex marriage, and gay sex.[340]

Pay raises for Congress

In 2019, Ocasio-Cortez supported pay raises for Congress. She wrote, ""It's not a fun or politically popular position to take. But consistency is important. ALL workers should get cost of living increases. That's why minimum wage should be pegged to inflation, too."" Members of Congress make $174,000 annually; the Speaker makes $223,500 and House leaders make $193,400. Republican Kevin McCarthy joined her in supporting the pay raise, saying he did not want Congress to be a place where only the wealthy can afford to serve. Colleagues such as Joe Cunningham opposed the measure, saying, ""We didn't come up here to give ourselves a raise"".[341]

Trump impeachments

On June 28, 2018, Ocasio-Cortez told CNN she would support the first impeachment of President Trump, citing Trump's alleged violations of the Emoluments Clause and saying that ""we have to hold everyone accountable and that no person is above that law.""[342][343]

Ocasio-Cortez supported impeaching Trump a second time for his attempts to overturn the 2020 United States presidential election. On January 3, 2021, she said that the Trump–Raffensperger phone call constituted an impeachable offense, and called it a ""despicable abuse of power"".[344] After January 6, she and many other Democrats co-sponsored an article of impeachment against Trump. Ocasio-Cortez said that Trump should be permanently barred from office and impeached.[345]

Andrew Cuomo scandals

In April 2020, Ocasio-Cortez was one of 77 representatives to call for public reports of data on COVID-19 cases in nursing homes and long-term care facilities.[346] In March 2021, she and Representative Jamaal Bowman called on New York Governor Andrew Cuomo to resign, citing the sexual misconduct allegations against him as well as the New York COVID-19 nursing home scandal about the Cuomo administration's reported undercounting of COVID-19 nursing home deaths.[347]

Puerto Rico

Ocasio-Cortez has called for ""solidarity with Puerto Rico"". She has advocated for granting Puerto Ricans further civil rights, regardless of Puerto Rico's legal classification. She advocates for voting rights and disaster relief. Ocasio-Cortez was critical of FEMA's response to Hurricane Maria and the federal government's unwillingness to address Puerto Rico's political status.[348] She believes the federal government should increase investment in Puerto Rico.[256] In August 2020, Ocasio-Cortez and Nydia Velázquez introduced the Puerto Rico Self-Determination Act of 2020, which was referred to the House Committee on Natural Resources.[349][350]

On March 18, 2021, Ocasio-Cortez, Velázquez and Senator Bob Menendez introduced a new version, the Puerto Rico Self-Determination Act of 2021,[351] with over 70 co-sponsors in the House and seven co-sponsors in the Senate, including one Republican.[352]

Withdrawal of Biden

After the June 2024 presidential debate, Ocasio-Cortez, who previously supported Biden during the campaign,[353] said that she had spoken with Biden and that he made clear he was staying in the race. She said that she supported him and that her focus was defeating Republicans in the election.[354][355][356] Later, on July 19, she held an Instagram Live in which she said that replacing Biden was risky and legally challenging, but suggested that nominating Vice President Kamala Harris was better than an open convention.[357] When Biden withdrew from the race, she endorsed Harris.[358]

Banning of Congressional stock trading

In May 2023, Ocasio-Cortez was a part of a bipartisan group that introduced the Bipartisan Restoring Faith in Government Act. This act bars members of Congress from owning or trading individual stocks. Other members of this bipartisan group were Matt Gaetz, Brian Fitzpatrick, and Raja Krishnamoorthi.[359]

Healthcare

Ocasio-Cortez supports transitioning to a single-payer healthcare system and considers medical care a human right.[360][361] She says that a single government health insurer should cover every American, reducing overall costs.[252] Her campaign website says, ""Almost every other developed nation in the world has universal healthcare. It's time the United States catch up to the rest of the world in ensuring all people have real healthcare coverage that doesn't break the bank.""[361] Many 2020 Democratic presidential candidates adopted the Medicare-for-all proposal.[254]

In June 2019 and in July 2021, Ocasio-Cortez proposed legislation that would remove restrictions placed on researching the medical use of psilocybin.[362][363]

In 2024, Ocasio-Cortez said of the killing of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson: ""this is not to say that an act of violence is justified"", but ""people interpret and feel and experience denied claims as an act of violence against them"".[364]

Social issues

Ocasio-Cortez with Camila Vallejo in Chile in 2023

Abortion rights

Ocasio-Cortez supports codifying the right to abortion, and is a member of the House pro-choice caucus.[365] On July 19, 2022, after the Supreme Court overruled Roe v. Wade in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization, she and 17 other members of Congress were arrested in an act of civil disobedience for refusing to clear a street during a protest for reproductive rights outside the Supreme Court Building.[366][367]

Education

Ocasio-Cortez campaigned in favor of establishing tuition-free public colleges and trade schools. She has said she is still paying off student loans herself and wants to cancel all student debt.[361]

Immigration

Ocasio-Cortez has expressed support for defunding and abolishing the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency on multiple occasions. In February 2018 she called it ""a product of the Bush-era Patriot Act suite of legislation"" and ""an enforcement agency that takes on more of a paramilitary tone every single day"".[368][369] That June, she said she would ""stop short of fully disbanding the agency"", and would rather ""create a pathway to citizenship for more immigrants through decriminalization"".[370] She later clarified that this does not mean ceasing all deportations.[371] Two days before the primary election, Ocasio-Cortez attended a protest at an ICE child-detention center in Tornillo, Texas.[372] She was the only Democrat to vote against H.R. 648, a bill to fund and reopen the government, because it funded ICE.[373]

In June 2019, Ocasio-Cortez compared the detention centers for undocumented immigrants under the Trump administration at the Mexico–United States border to ""concentration camps"". She cited ""expert analysis"", linking to an Esquire article quoting Andrea Pitzer, author of One Long Night: A Global History of Concentration Camps, who had made a similar claim.[374][375] Some academics supported Ocasio-Cortez's use of the term for the forced detention of immigrants;[376][377] others strongly criticized it, saying it showed disrespect for Holocaust victims.[378] In response to criticism from both Republicans and Democrats,[379] Ocasio-Cortez said they had conflated concentration camps (""the mass detention of civilians without trial"") with death camps.[380] She refused to apologize for using the term: ""If that makes you uncomfortable, fight the camps, not the nomenclature.""[381]

In July 2019, Ocasio-Cortez visited migrant detention centers and other facilities in Texas as part of a congressional delegation to witness the border crisis firsthand. She called the conditions ""horrifying"". She said that women in one cell said they had not had access to showers for two weeks and were told to drink water from the toilet when their sink broke, and that one woman said that her daughters had been taken from her two weeks earlier and she did not know where they were.[382][383]

In January 2021, Ocasio-Cortez expressed support for the Roadmap to Freedom resolution to guide future immigration policy championed by Representative Pramila Jayapal. The resolution aims to safeguard vulnerable migrants while reducing criminal prosecutions of migrants.[384]

In February 2021, when the Biden administration reopened a Carrizo Springs, Texas, center to house unaccompanied migrant children, Ocasio-Cortez responded that such actions ""never will be okay—no matter the administration or party"".[385] For short-term measures to address the situation, she called for mandatory licensing for such centers and urged reconsideration of how the centers are ""contracted out"".[386]

LGBT+ rights

Ocasio-Cortez is a proponent of LGBT+ rights and equality. She has said she supports the community and thanked its members for their role in her campaign.[387][256] At the January 2019 New York City Women's March in Manhattan, Ocasio-Cortez gave a detailed speech in support of measures needed to ensure LGBT+ equality in the workplace and elsewhere.[388] She has also spoken in support of transgender rights, specifically saying, ""Trans rights are civil rights are human rights.""[389] Later, she appeared on a video game live stream to help raise money for Mermaids, a UK-based charity for transgender children.[390]

At the House Committee on Oversight and Reform on February 27, 2020, Ocasio-Cortez argued for LGBTQ equality in the context of her religious background. Referencing a Catholic hospital that refused a hysterectomy for a transgender man,[391] she argued, ""[t]here is nothing holy about rejecting medical care of people, no matter who they are, on the grounds of what their identity is. There is nothing holy about turning someone away from a hospital.""[392][393]

Police funding

When asked what America would look like if it defunded the police, she responded on Instagram Live:

It looks like a suburb. Affluent white communities already live in a world where the choose to fund youth, health, housing etc more than they fund police. When a teenager or preteen does something harmful in a suburb (I say teen bc this is often where lifelong carceral cycles begin for Black and Brown communities), White communities bend over backwards to find alternatives to incarceration for their loved ones to protect their future, like community service or rehab or restorative measures. Why don't we treat Black and Brown people the same way?[394]

Personal life

After the death of Ocasio-Cortez's father in 2008, her mother and grandmother moved to Florida due to financial hardship.[15][36] She still has family in Puerto Rico, where her grandfather was living in a nursing home[348] before he died in the aftermath of Hurricane Maria.[400] Ocasio-Cortez has said that ""to be Puerto Rican is to be the descendant of ... African Moors [and] slaves, Taino Indians, Spanish colonizers, Jewish refugees, and likely others. We are all of these things and something else all at once—we are Boricua.""[17] She has said she has some Sephardic Jewish ancestry.[401]

Ocasio-Cortez is a Catholic. She discussed her faith and its impact on her life and her campaign for criminal justice reform in a 2018 article she wrote for America, the magazine of the Jesuit order in the United States.[402]

During the 2018 election campaign, Ocasio-Cortez resided in Parkchester, Bronx, with her partner, web developer Riley Roberts.[403][404][405] They became engaged in April 2022 in Puerto Rico.[406]

In 2021, the watchdog group OpenSecrets, analyzing financial disclosure forms, ranked Ocasio-Cortez one of the least wealthy members of the 116th Congress, with a maximum net worth of $30,000.[407]

In February 2021, Ocasio-Cortez said that she had been sexually assaulted.[408] That May, she said that she had been in psychotherapy after the January 6 United States Capitol attack, which she called ""extraordinarily traumatizing"", saying she ""did not know if I was going to make it to the end of that day alive"".[409]

Ocasio-Cortez is a fan of the New York Yankees.[410] She has a pet French Bulldog named Deco, after the Art Deco movement.[411]

Ted Cruz,United States,en,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ted_Cruz,"American politician (born 1970)

Rafael Edward Cruz ( ; born December 22, 1970) is an American politician and attorney serving as the junior United States senator from Texas since 2013. A member of the Republican Party, Cruz was the solicitor general of Texas from 2003 to 2008.

After graduating from Princeton University and Harvard Law School, Cruz pursued a career in politics, eventually serving as a policy advisor in the George W. Bush administration. In 2003, Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott appointed Cruz to serve as Solicitor General, a position he held until 2008. Cruz was elected to the U.S. Senate in 2012, becoming the first Hispanic American to serve as a U.S. senator from Texas.[2] In the Senate, he has taken consistently conservative positions on economic and social policy. He played a leading role in the 2013 federal government shutdown, seeking to force Congress and President Barack Obama to defund the Affordable Care Act. Cruz was reelected in a close race in 2018 against Democratic nominee Beto O'Rourke and decisively won a third term in 2024 against Congressman Colin Allred.

In 2016, Cruz sought the Republican presidential nomination, emerging as a serious competitor to front-runner Donald Trump in a primary marked by intense, often personal, exchanges. Cruz initially withheld his endorsement after Trump secured the nomination, but became a strong supporter during Trump's first term. In 2021, Cruz objected to the certification of Joe Biden's victory in the 2020 presidential election.

Early life and family

Rafael Edward Cruz was born on December 22, 1970,[3][4] at Foothills Medical Centre[5][6] in Calgary, Alberta, Canada, to Eleanor Elizabeth (née Darragh) Wilson and Rafael Cruz.[7][8][9][10] Cruz's mother was born in Wilmington, Delaware. She is of three-quarters Irish and one-quarter Italian descent, and earned an undergraduate degree in mathematics from Rice University in the 1950s.[11][12]

Cruz's father, Rafael, was born and raised in Cuba, the son of a Canary Islander who immigrated to Cuba as a child.[13] As a teenager in the 1950s, Rafael Cruz was beaten by agents of Fulgencio Batista for opposing the Batista regime.[14] He left Cuba in 1957 to attend the University of Texas at Austin and obtained political asylum in the United States after his four-year student visa expired.[15] He earned Canadian citizenship in 1973[5] and became a naturalized United States citizen in 2005.[9][16][17]

At the time of his birth, Ted Cruz's parents had lived in Calgary for three years and were working in the oil business as owners of a seismic-data processing firm for oil drilling.[9][18][19][20][21] Cruz has said that he is the son of ""two mathematicians/computer programmers"".[22] In 1974, Cruz's father left the family and moved to Texas.[23] Later that year, Cruz's parents reconciled and relocated the family to Houston.[5] They divorced in 1997.[24] Cruz has two older half-sisters, Miriam Ceferina Cruz and Roxana Lourdes Cruz, from his father's first marriage. Miriam died in 2011 from a drug overdose.[24][25][26]

Cruz began using the moniker ""Ted"" at age 13.[27]

Education

For junior high school, Cruz went to Awty International School in Houston.[28] Cruz attended two private high schools: Faith West Academy, near Katy, Texas;[29] and Second Baptist High School in Houston, from which he graduated as valedictorian in 1988.[16][30][31] During high school, Cruz participated in a Houston-based group known at the time as the Free Market Education Foundation, a program that taught high school students the philosophies of economists such as Milton Friedman and Frédéric Bastiat.[21][32]

After high school, Cruz studied public policy at Princeton University.[33][3][34] While at Princeton, he competed for the American Whig-Cliosophic Society's Debate Panel and won the top speaker award at both the 1992 U.S. National Debating Championship and the 1992 North American Debating Championship.[35] In 1992, he was named U.S. National Speaker of the Year and, with his debate partner David Panton, Team of the Year by the American Parliamentary Debate Association.[35] Cruz and Panton later represented Harvard Law School at the 1995 World Debating Championship, losing in the semifinals to a team from Australia.[36][37][38] Princeton's debate team named their annual novice championship after Cruz.[38] At Princeton, Cruz was a member of Colonial Club.[39] His 115-page senior thesis at Princeton investigated the separation of powers; its title, Clipping the Wings of Angels: The History and Theory Behind the Ninth and Tenth Amendments of the United States Constitution, was inspired by a passage attributed to James Madison from the 51st essay of the Federalist Papers: ""If angels were to govern men, neither external nor internal controls on government would be necessary."" Cruz argued that the drafters of the Constitution intended to protect their constituents' rights, and that the last two items in the Bill of Rights offer an explicit stop against an all-powerful state.[11][40] Cruz graduated from Princeton in 1992 with a Bachelor of Arts cum laude.[41]

Cruz then attended Harvard Law School,[3][42] where he was a John M. Olin Fellow in Law and Economics.[43] He was a primary editor of the Harvard Law Review, an executive editor of the Harvard Journal of Law and Public Policy, and a founding editor of the Harvard Latino Law Review.[34] Referring to Cruz's time as a student at Harvard Law, professor Alan Dershowitz said that Cruz was ""off-the-charts brilliant"".[44][45][46][47] Cruz graduated from Harvard Law in 1995 with a Juris Doctor degree magna cum laude.[41]

Legal career

Clerkships

After law school, Cruz served as a law clerk for Judge J. Michael Luttig of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit from 1995 to 1996,[43][48] and then for Chief Justice William Rehnquist of the U.S. Supreme Court from 1996 to 1997.[3]

Private practice

After his Supreme Court clerkship, Cruz worked in private practice as an associate at the law firm Cooper, Carvin & Rosenthal (now Cooper & Kirk, PLLC) from 1997 to 1998.[49] At the firm, Cruz worked on matters relating to the National Rifle Association and helped prepare testimony for the impeachment proceedings against President Bill Clinton.[50] In 1998, Cruz was briefly one of the attorneys who represented Representative John Boehner during his litigation against Representative Jim McDermott over the alleged leak of an illegal recording of a phone conversation whose participants included Boehner.[51][52]

Bush administration

Cruz joined the George W. Bush presidential campaign in 1999 as a domestic policy adviser, advising then-Governor Bush on a wide range of policy and legal matters, including civil justice, criminal justice, constitutional law, immigration, and government reform.[49] During the 2000 Florida presidential recounts, he assisted in assembling the Bush legal team, devising strategy, and drafting pleadings for filing with the Supreme Court of Florida and U.S. Supreme Court in the case Bush v. Gore.[43][53] Cruz recruited future chief justice John Roberts and noted attorney Mike Carvin to Bush's legal team.[50]

After Bush took office, Cruz served as an associate deputy attorney general in the United States Department of Justice[3][53] and as the director of policy planning at the Federal Trade Commission.[3][44][53]

Texas Solicitor General

In 2003, Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott appointed Cruz to be the solicitor general of Texas.[48][54][32][43] The office was established in 1999 to handle appeals involving the Texas state government, but Abbott hired Cruz with the idea that Cruz would take a ""leadership role in the United States in articulating a vision of strict constructionism"". As Texas solicitor general, Cruz argued before the U.S. Supreme Court nine times, winning five cases and losing four.[50] He authored 70 U.S. Supreme Court briefs and presented 34 appellate oral arguments.[44][48][55] His nine appearances before the Supreme Court are the most by any practicing lawyer in Texas or current member of Congress.[56] Cruz has said, ""We ended up year after year arguing some of the biggest cases in the country. There was a degree of serendipity in that, but there was also a concerted effort to seek out and lead conservative fights.""[56]

In 2003, while Cruz was Texas Solicitor General, the Texas Attorney General's office declined to defend Texas's sodomy law in Lawrence v. Texas, in which the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that state laws banning homosexual sex were unconstitutional.[57] In the landmark case District of Columbia v. Heller, Cruz drafted the amicus brief signed by the attorneys general of 31 states arguing that the Washington, D.C. handgun ban should be struck down as infringing upon the Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms.[55][58] He also presented oral argument for the amici states in the companion case to Heller before the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.[55][59]

Cruz at the Values Voter Summit in October 2011

Cruz successfully defended the constitutionality of the Ten Commandments monument on the Texas State Capitol grounds before the Fifth Circuit and the U.S. Supreme Court, winning 5–4 in Van Orden v. Perry.[44][43][55]

In 2004, Cruz was involved in the high-profile case surrounding a challenge to the constitutionality of public schools' requiring students to recite the Pledge of Allegiance (including the words ""under God"", legally a part of the Pledge since 1954), Elk Grove Unified School District v. Newdow.[44][43] He wrote a brief on behalf of all 50 states that argued that the plaintiff, a non-custodial parent, did not have standing to file suit on his daughter's behalf.[60] The Supreme Court upheld the position of Cruz's brief.[61]

Cruz served as lead counsel for the state and successfully defended the multiple litigation challenges to the 2003 Texas congressional redistricting plan in state and federal district courts and before the U.S. Supreme Court, which was decided 5–4 in his favor in League of United Latin American Citizens v. Perry.[43][62]

In Medellín v. Texas, Cruz successfully defended Texas against an attempt to reopen the cases of 51 Mexican nationals, all of whom were convicted of murder in the United States and on death row.[44][43][48][55] With the support of the George W. Bush administration, the petitioners argued that the United States had violated the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations by failing to notify the convicted nationals of their opportunity to receive legal aid from the Mexican consulate.[50][63] They based their case on a decision of the International Court of Justice in the Avena case, which ruled that by failing to allow access to the Mexican consulate, the United States had breached its obligations under the convention.[64] Texas won the case in a 6–3 decision, the Supreme Court holding that ICJ decisions were not binding in domestic law and that the President had no power to enforce them.[50][63]

Michael Wayne Haley was arrested for stealing a calculator from Walmart in 1997.[65] Because of Haley's previous criminal convictions, he was sentenced to 16+1⁄2 years in prison under the Texas habitual offender law. After Haley had exhausted his appeals, it became known that Haley's robbery offense occurred three days before one of his other convictions was finalized; this raised a question about the applicability of the habitual offender statute in his case. As Solicitor General, Cruz declined to vacate Haley's sentence, saying, ""I think justice is being done because he had a full and fair trial and an opportunity to raise his errors.""[66] The Supreme Court later remanded the case to lower courts based on Haley's ineffective assistance of counsel claim. During oral argument, Cruz conceded that Haley had a very strong argument for ineffective assistance of counsel since Haley's attorney failed to recognize the sentencing error and that he would not move to have Haley re-incarcerated during the appeal process.[66] After remand, Haley was re-sentenced to ""time served"".[67]

In 2008 American Lawyer magazine named Cruz one of the 50 Best Litigators under 45 in America,[54][68] and The National Law Journal named him one of the 50 Most Influential Minority Lawyers in America.[69][70] In 2010 Texas Lawyer named him one of the 25 Greatest Texas Lawyers of the Past Quarter Century.[71][72]

Return to private practice

After leaving the Solicitor General position in 2008, Cruz joined the Houston office of the Philadelphia-based law firm Morgan, Lewis & Bockius, often representing corporate clients.[11][43][73] At Morgan Lewis, he led the firm's U.S. Supreme Court and national appellate litigation practice.[73] In 2010, he abandoned a bid for state attorney general when incumbent Attorney General Greg Abbott, who hired Cruz as solicitor general, decided to run for reelection.[16]

At Morgan, Lewis & Bockius, Cruz represented Pfizer in a lawsuit brought by a group of public hospitals and community health centers, who accused Pfizer of overcharging.[74] Linglong Tire was found guilty of marketing versions of tires that were based on blueprints stolen by a former employee of a Florida businessman and ordered to pay $26 million to the Floridian. Cruz worked on the Chinese company's appellant brief. The appeals court denied the appeal and affirmed the jury's award.[75] Cruz represented drug manufacturer B. Braun before the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit after the company was found guilty of wrongfully discharging a former employee. Cruz asserted that she had failed to prove that B. Braun had directed her to violate the law and that she had not presented sufficient evidence that her refusal to violate the law was why she had been fired. The appeals court rejected Cruz's argument and affirmed the $880,000 award.[75] Cruz represented Toyota in an appeal to the Texas Supreme Court in a statute of limitations case, where a judge wanted to investigate Toyota for contempt after a former Toyota in-house lawyer accused Toyota of unlawfully withholding documents in a product liability case.[76] Cruz unsuccessfully argued the judge's jurisdiction expired 30 days after the case was dismissed following an out-of-court settlement, but later won a second appeal using the same argument.[77]

Cruz defended two record-setting $54-million personal injury awards in New Mexico at the appellate level, including one that a lower court had thrown out.[78] He represented a mentally disabled man who was allegedly raped by an employee of the facility where he lived, and the family of a 78-year-old resident of an Albuquerque nursing home who died of internal bleeding.[78][79] The settlements were sealed in both cases.[78][79]

Cruz during the 113th Congress

Cruz ran as a Tea Party candidate in the 2012 Republican primary,[80][81][82] and The Washington Post called his victory ""the biggest upset of 2012 ... a true grassroots victory against very long odds"".[83]

On January 19, 2011, after U.S. Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison said she would not seek reelection, Cruz launched his campaign via a blogger conference call.[84] In the Republican primary, he ran against sitting Lieutenant Governor David Dewhurst. Cruz was endorsed first by former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin[85] and then by the Club for Growth, a fiscally conservative political action committee;[86] the FreedomWorks for America super PAC;[87] nationally syndicated radio host Mark Levin;[88] Tea Party Express;[89] Young Conservatives of Texas;[90] and U.S. senators Tom Coburn, Jim DeMint,[91] Mike Lee,[92] Rand Paul[93] and Pat Toomey.[94] He was also endorsed by former Texas Congressman Ron Paul,[95] George P. Bush,[53] and former U.S. senator from Pennsylvania Rick Santorum.[96] Former Attorney General Ed Meese served as national chairman of Cruz's campaign.[53]

Cruz won the runoff for the Republican nomination by a 14-point margin over Dewhurst, support for Dewhurst having plummeted while Cruz's vote total dramatically increased from the first round.[97] Cruz won despite being outspent by Dewhurst, who held a statewide elected office,[98] $19 million to $7 million.[98][99]

In the November 6 general election, Cruz faced Democratic nominee Paul Sadler, an attorney and a former state representative from Henderson, Texas. Cruz won with 4.5 million votes (56.4%) to Sadler's 3.2 million (40.6%). Two minor candidates garnered the remaining 3% of the vote.[100] According to a poll by Cruz's pollster Wilson Perkins Allen Opinion Research, Cruz received 40% of the Hispanic vote, outperforming Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney among Hispanics in Texas.[101][102]

After Time magazine reported that Cruz might have violated ethics rules by failing to publicly disclose his financial relationship with Caribbean Equity Partners Investment Holdings during the 2012 campaign, he said his failure to disclose the connection was inadvertent.[103]

In January 2016, The New York Times reported that Cruz and his wife had taken out nearly $1 million in low-interest loans from Goldman Sachs (where she worked) and Citibank, and failed to report them on Federal Election Commission disclosure statements as required by law.[104] Cruz disclosed the loans on his Senate financial disclosure forms in July 2012, but not on the FEC form.[105] There is no indication that Cruz's wife had any role in providing any of the loans, or that the banks did anything wrong.[105] The loans were largely repaid by later campaign fundraising. A spokesperson for Cruz said his failure to report the loans to the FEC was ""inadvertent"" and that he would file supplementary paperwork.[104] But Cruz intentionally missed the deadline for repayment in order to challenge the law that only $250,000 in personal loans can be repaid with money raised after an election. In May 2022, the Supreme Court in FEC v. Ted Cruz for Senate sided with Cruz, allowing him to ask donors to help repay $555,000 he loaned to his campaigns: $545,000 he loaned to his 2012 campaign, plus $10,000 he loaned to his 2018 campaign that was over the existing limit of $250,000.[106][107]

2018

Final results by county in 2018:

Ted Cruz >90%

80–90%

70–80%

60–70%

50–60%

Cruz ran for reelection to a second term in 2018.[108] The primary elections for both parties were held on March 6, 2018,[109] and he easily won the Republican nomination with over 80% of the vote.

Cruz faced the Democratic nominee, U.S. Representative Beto O'Rourke, in the general election.[110] The contest was unusually competitive for an election in Texas, with most polls showing Cruz only slightly ahead. The race received significant media attention[111] and became the most expensive U.S. Senate election in history up to that point[112] (until the 2020–21 Georgia special election between incumbent Kelly Loeffler and Raphael Warnock). On November 6, 2018, Cruz defeated O'Rourke by a slim margin, 50.9% to 48.3%.[113]

2024

Cruz ran for a third Senate term.[114] On November 5, he defeated Democratic nominee Colin Allred, a former NFL player and U.S. representative,[115] 53.1% to 44.5%.[116]

Legislation

Cruz presents a U.S. flag to World War II veteran Richard Arvin Overton during opening ceremony for outpatient clinic in Austin on August 22, 2013.

As of November 2018, Cruz has sponsored 105 bills of his own, including:[117]

Government shutdown of 2013

Cruz had a leading role in the 2013 United States federal government shutdown.[118][119][120][121][122] Cruz gave a 21-hour Senate speech in an effort to hold up a federal budget bill and thereby defund the Affordable Care Act.[121][123][124] Cruz persuaded the House of Representatives and House Speaker John Boehner to include an ACA defunding provision in the bill.[122] In the U.S. Senate, former Majority Leader Harry Reid blocked the filibuster attempt because only 18 Republican senators supported the filibuster.[122] During the filibuster he read Green Eggs and Ham by Dr. Seuss.[125] To supporters, the move ""signaled the depth of Cruz's commitment to rein in government"".[121] This move was extremely popular among Cruz supporters, with Rick Manning of Americans for Limited Government naming Cruz ""2013 Person of the Year"" in an op-ed in The Hill, primarily for his filibuster against the Affordable Care Act.[126] Cruz was also named ""2013 Man of the Year"" by conservative publications TheBlaze,[127] and The American Spectator,[128] ""2013 Conservative of the Year"" by Townhall,[129] and ""2013 Statesman of the Year"" by the Republican Party of Sarasota County, Florida.[130][131] He was a finalist for Time magazine's ""Person of the Year"" in 2013.[132] To critics, including some Republican colleagues[122] such as Senator Lindsey Graham, the move was ineffective.[121]

Cruz has consistently denied any involvement in the 2013 government shutdown, even though he cast several votes to prolong it and was blamed by many within his own party for prompting it.[133][134]

S. 2195

On April 1, 2014, Cruz introduced S. 2195, a bill that would allow the president of the United States to deny visas to any ambassador to the United Nations who has been found to have been engaged in espionage or terrorist activity against the United States or its allies and may pose a threat to U.S. national security interests.[135] The bill was written in response to Iran's choice of Hamid Aboutalebi as its ambassador to the UN.[136] Aboutalebi was involved in the Iran hostage crisis, in which of a number of American diplomats from the Embassy of the United States, Tehran were held captive in 1979.[136][137][138]

Under the headline ""A bipartisan message to Iran"", Cruz thanked President Barack Obama for signing S. 2195 into law. The letter, published in the magazine Politico on April 18, 2014, starts with ""Thanks to President Obama for joining a unanimous Congress and signing S. 2195 into law"". Cruz also thanked senators from both political parties for ""swiftly passing this legislation and sending it to the White House"".[139][140][141]

Committee assignments

In his first two years in the Senate, Cruz attended 17 of 50 public Armed Services Committee hearings, 3 of 25 Commerce Committee hearings, and 4 of the 12 Judiciary Committee hearings, and he missed 21 of 135 roll call votes during the first three months of 2015.[142]

Current

Previous

In a November 2014 Senate speech, Cruz accused President Obama of being ""openly desirous to destroy the Constitution and this Republic"".[144] In the same speech, Cruz invoked the speeches of the ancient Roman senator Cicero against Catiline to denounce Obama's planned executive actions on immigration reform.[144] Classics Professor Jesse Weiner, writing in The Atlantic, said that Cruz's analogy was ""deeply disquieting"" because ""In casting Obama in the role of Catiline, Cruz unsubtly suggests that the sitting president was not lawfully elected and is the perpetrator of a violent insurrection to overthrow the government ... In effect, he accuses the president of high treason. Regardless of one's views on immigration reform and the Obama administration at large, this is dangerous rhetoric.""[144]

Cruz has repeatedly said that the 2015 international nuclear agreement with Iran ""will make the Obama administration the world's leading financier of radical Islamic terrorism"".[145] In response, Obama called Cruz's statements an example of ""outrageous attacks"" from Republican critics that crossed the line of responsible discourse: ""We've had a sitting senator, who also happens to be running for President, suggest that I'm the leading state sponsor of terrorism. Maybe this is just an effort to push Mr. Trump out of the headlines, but it's not the kind of leadership that is needed for America right now.""[145] Former Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney also criticized Cruz's remarks, writing that although he, too, opposed the Iran agreement, Cruz's statement connecting Obama to terrorism was ""way over the line"" and ""hurts the cause"".[146][147]

After the death of Associate Justice Antonin Scalia, Cruz said that the winner of the 2016 U.S. presidential election, rather than Obama, should appoint a new Justice.[148] In June 2016, Cruz blamed the Obama administration for the Orlando nightclub shooting, reasoning that it did not track the perpetrator Omar Mateen properly while he was on the terrorist watch-list.[149] Following the terrorist attack on Nice, France, Cruz said in a statement that the country was at risk as a result of the Obama administration having a ""willful blindness"" to radical Islamists.[150] With the death of Fidel Castro in November, Cruz charged Obama with celebrating and lionizing Castro in public statements he made addressing the death.[151] On December 28, after Secretary of State John Kerry gave a speech defending the U.S.'s decision to allow a U.N. resolution to pass that condemned Israeli settlements ""on land meant to be part of a future Palestinian state"", Cruz denounced the speech as ""disgraceful"", and said that history would remember Obama and Kerry as ""relentless enemies of Israel"". Cruz also accused the Obama administration of having a ""radical anti-Israel agenda"".[152]

Relationship with Donald Trump

Cruz and then-President Donald Trump in 2019

Cruz was one of Donald Trump's most vocal critics during the 2016 presidential campaign, with the two often exchanging heated comments directed at each other, and Cruz's family.[153] But he eventually became an important ally of Trump's in the Senate.[154][155]

Cruz said to journalists of Donald Trump: ""I wake up every day and laugh at the latest thing Donald has tweeted, because he’s losing it. We need a commander in chief, not a Twitterer in chief. We need someone with judgment and the temperament to keep this country safe.""[156]

In late January 2017, Cruz praised Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch as ""brilliant and immensely talented"" in a written statement.[157] On February 23, while speaking at the 2017 CPAC, Cruz showed interest in Trump's nomination of a young justice in the mold of Scalia and Clarence Thomas.[158] On March 1, he called Trump's joint address to Congress the previous day ""positive"" and ""unifying"".[159] Cruz said that during his visit to the Mar-a-Lago estate on March 18, he spoke with affiliates of Trump while negotiating the American Health Care Act.[160] On April 6, shortly after the Shayrat missile strike, he released a statement displaying his interest in having Trump appeal to Congress to take ""military action in Syria"" to prevent Islamic terrorists from acquiring weapons stored in Syria.[161]

In April 2018, in the copy accompanying Trump's entry on the Time 100 most influential people of 2017, Cruz wrote, ""President Trump is doing what he was elected to do: disrupt the status quo.""[162] Cruz's authorship was criticized by Charles Pierce of Esquire,[163] Jay Willis of GQ,[164] and CNN's Chris Cillizza.[162]

Cruz endorsed Trump for the Republican nomination in the 2024 presidential election.[165]

Friction with fellow Republican members of Congress

Cruz has used harsh rhetoric against fellow Republican politicians, and his relationships with various Republican members of Congress have been strained.[166][167] In 2013, he called Republicans he considered insufficiently resistant to Obama's proposals a ""surrender caucus"".[166] He also called fellow Republicans ""squishes"" on gun-control issues during a Tea Party rally.[166] Cruz's role in the United States federal government shutdown of 2013 in particular attracted criticism from a number of Republican colleagues.[167] Republican Senator John McCain was reported to have particularly disliked Cruz; in a Senate floor speech in 2013, McCain denounced Cruz's reference to Nazis when discussing the Affordable Care Act.[167] In March 2013, McCain also called Cruz and others ""wacko birds"" whose beliefs are not ""reflective of the views of the majority of Republicans"".[167] During the 2016 Republican presidential primaries, John Boehner described Cruz as ""Lucifer in the flesh"";[168] in an interview, Lindsey Graham said, ""If you killed Ted Cruz on the floor of the Senate, and the trial was in the Senate, nobody would convict you.""[169]

In a heated Senate floor speech in July 2015, Cruz accused Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell of telling ""a flat-out lie"" over his intentions to reauthorize the Export-Import Bank of the United States, which Cruz opposes. ""What we just saw today was an absolute demonstration that not only what he told every Republican senator, but what he told the press over and over and over again was a simple lie"", Cruz said.[170] His ""incendiary outburst"" was ""unusual in the cordial atmosphere of the Senate"", according to Reuters.[170][171] In the same speech, Cruz assailed the ""Republican majority in both houses of Congresses"" for what he called an insufficiently conservative record.[171] His speech, and especially his accusation against McConnell, was condemned by various senior Republican senators, with McCain saying that the speech was ""outside the realm of Senate behavior"" and ""a very wrong thing to do"".[172] Orrin Hatch expressed a similar opinion: ""I don't condone the use of that kind of language against another senator unless they can show definitive proof that there was a lie ... And I know the leader didn't lie.""[173] Cruz alleged that McConnell scheduled a vote on the Ex-Im Bank as part of a deal to persuade Democrats like Maria Cantwell to stop blocking a trade bill; McConnell denied there was any ""deal"", and that denial was what Cruz called a ""lie"". Hatch said McConnell did pledge to help Cantwell get a vote on the Ex-Im Bank.[174]

Among Cruz's few close allies in the Senate is Mike Lee of Utah.[175][176] Cruz has expressed pride in his reputation for having few allies, saying in June 2015 that he has been vilified for fighting ""the Washington cartel"".[177]

When Boehner resigned from the House in September 2015, Cruz expressed his concern that before resigning Boehner might have ""cut a deal with Nancy Pelosi to fund the Obama administration for the rest of its tenure"".[178] The next month, the budget agreement passed in the House by a vote of 266 to 187, with unanimous support from Democrats and Boehner, lifting the debt ceiling through March 2017. Cruz called the agreement ""complete and utter surrender"".[179]

Cruz is one of the Senate Republicans in favor of the ""nuclear option"", ""to speed up consideration of President Trump's nominees"". Changing the Senate's rules to a simple majority vote would ""ensure a quicker pace on Trump's court picks"".[180]

U.S. Supreme Court

In September 2020, Trump included Cruz on a shortlist, alongside fellow Senators Tom Cotton and Josh Hawley, for possible appointment to the Supreme Court. Cruz declined consideration for the position.[181]

2020 presidential election

Cruz backed a failed appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court attempting to overturn or nullify the 2020 presidential election in Pennsylvania filed by U.S. Representative Mike Kelly, which argued that the Pennsylvania Constitution requires in-person voting except in narrow and defined circumstances; the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania had already rejected this argument.[182][183][184] The U.S. Supreme Court declined to take up the case or issue an injunction and Pennsylvania's Electoral College votes were cast for Joe Biden.[185] Cruz later led an effort by a group of Republican senators to refuse to count Pennsylvania's Electoral College votes,[186][187] citing baseless allegations of fraud.[188] He attacked critics of his attempts to challenge the election results for using ""angry language"", suggesting that they were increasing tensions amid a volatile situation.[189]

Electoral College vote count and storming of the United States Capitol

As part of the attempts to overturn the 2020 presidential election that Trump lost, Texas attorney general Ken Paxton filed a suit with the U.S. Supreme Court, seeking to have election results in four states nullified. Cruz, who had previously argued nine cases before the Supreme Court, agreed to Trump's request to argue the Paxton suit should it come before the Court, though it did not. Cruz also garnered the support of ten other senators for a plan by his decades-long friend, Trump attorney John Eastman, to delay the January 6 electoral vote certification for ten days to allow Republican legislatures in six key states Biden had won to consider submitting slates of Trump electors, based on false allegations of widespread voting fraud. Cruz said he was he was ""leading the charge"" to prevent Biden's certification as president.[190][191]

On January 6, 2021, during the debate about whether Congress should accept Arizona's electoral votes, Cruz said that 39% of Americans believed the 2020 presidential election was rigged, but that ""I am not arguing for setting aside the result of this election"".[192] Some observers think Cruz knew claims about fraud in the election were inaccurate and that this speech and his earlier statements were attempts to mislead for political gain.[192] 39% of Americans said they ""strongly"" or ""somewhat agree"" that ""I am concerned that the election is rigged""; an Ipsos spokesman noted that only 28% agreed the outcome was ""the result of illegal voting or election rigging"".[193][194]

Congress's counting of the Electoral College votes was interrupted by an insurrectionist mob that stormed the United States Capitol after a rally near the White House. The attack resulted in the deaths of five people, including a police officer.[195]

When Congress reconvened that evening to continue the count, Cruz voted to object to Arizona's and Pennsylvania's electoral votes.[196] The Senate rejected these objections by 93–6 and 92–7, respectively.[197] The Texas Democratic Party called on Cruz to resign, saying that his efforts to block Biden's lawful victory empowered the Trump supporters who stormed the Capitol.[198] The Texas Democratic Party also called on the U.S. Department of Justice to open an official investigation into Cruz for inciting sedition and treason.[199][200][201] The Houston Chronicle called for Cruz to resign.[202] The San Antonio Express-News called for Cruz to be expelled from the Senate.[203] Thousands of lawyers and law students called for him to be disbarred for inciting the insurrection.[204] President-elect Biden and Republican senator Pat Toomey both said Cruz was complicit in the ""big lie"" of Trump's allegations of voter fraud.[205] Republican operative Chad Sweet, the chair of Cruz's 2016 presidential campaign, denounced Cruz for ""assault on our democracy.""[206] Several corporations halted donations to Cruz and other Republicans who voted to overturn the election based on Trump's false claims.[207][208][209] Lauren Blair Bianchi, Cruz's communications director, resigned.[210]

On May 28, 2021, Cruz voted against creating an independent commission to investigate the riot.[211] On the eve of the anniversary of the attack, he was recorded on video calling it a ""violent terrorist attack"", which drew sharp criticism from Fox News host Tucker Carlson on his program that night. Cruz appeared on Carlson's program the next night to apologize for that comment as ""frankly dumb"" and ""sloppy."" The next day CNN reported that Cruz had characterized the attack as terrorism at least 17 times during the preceding year.[212][213][214] Despite his attempts to downplay the incident, Cruz was widely condemned by pro-Trump Republicans—especially Matt Gaetz and Marjorie Taylor Greene[215]—for his comments.

Cancún controversy

In February 2021, during a historic winter storm, up to 4.3 million Texas residents were left without power and millions of others without drinking water, including Cruz and his family. In the middle of the storm, Cruz and his family were spotted on a plane heading to Cancún, Mexico, where they planned to stay at the luxury Ritz Carlton hotel and escape their home, which Heidi Cruz called in a text message ""FREEZING"".[216][217][218] Cruz requested that the Houston police escort him and his family through the airport.[219]

Cruz left the family poodle, Snowflake, alone inside the house without heat; reporters saw the dog through the window of the front door of the dark and empty house.[220] Later, a self-identified security guard told a reporter he was caring for the dog.[221]

Cruz's political allies and rivals condemned him for leaving Texas during a crisis and traveling internationally during the COVID-19 pandemic.[216] Cruz initially said he was taking his daughters on a weeklong vacation from school at their request, in an attempt to be a ""good dad"".[222] Later that day, he returned to Texas, after allowing his family to stay in Mexico, saying that the vacation was a mistake.[223] Protesters calling for his resignation greeted him in front of his house upon his return.[224] After returning from Cancún, Cruz volunteered in Houston to help with recovery efforts.[225]

2016 presidential campaign

Cruz speaking at the 2014 Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) in National Harbor, Maryland

As early as 2013, Cruz was widely expected to run for the presidency in 2016.[226][227][228] On March 14, 2013, he gave the keynote speech at the annual Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) in Washington DC.[229] He tied for 7th place in the 2013 CPAC straw poll on March 16, winning 4% of the votes cast.[230] In October 2013, Cruz won the Values Voter Summit presidential straw poll with 42% of the vote.[231] Cruz finished first in two presidential straw polls conducted in 2014 with 30.33% of the vote at the Republican Leadership Conference[232] and 43% of the vote at the Republican Party of Texas state convention.[233]

Cruz did speaking events in mid-2013 across Iowa, New Hampshire, and South Carolina, all early primary states, leading to further speculation that he was laying the groundwork for a 2016 bid.[234] Legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin described Cruz as the first potential presidential candidate to emphasize originalism as a major national issue.[50]

On April 12, 2014, Cruz spoke at the Freedom Summit, an event organized by Americans for Prosperity and Citizens United.[235] The event was attended by several potential presidential candidates.[236] In his speech, Cruz mentioned that Latinos, young people and single mothers are the people most affected by the recession, and that the Republican Party should make outreach efforts to these constituents. He also said that the words ""growth and opportunity"" should be tattooed on the hands of every Republican politician.[235]

Cruz delivered one of many State of the Union responses in January 2015.[237]

On March 23, 2015, Cruz started his 2016 presidential campaign for the Republican primaries and caucuses, in a morning speech delivered at Liberty University in Lynchburg, Virginia.[238] Also, at the same hour, he posted on his Twitter page: ""I'm running for President and I hope to earn your support!""[239] He was the first major Republican presidential candidate for the 2016 campaign.[240][241] During the primary campaign, his base of support was mainly among social conservatives, though he had crossover appeal to other factions within his party, including in particular libertarian conservatives.[242][243]

HarperCollins published Cruz's book A Time for Truth: Reigniting the Promise of America on June 30, 2015.[244] The book reached the bestseller list of several organizations in its first week of release.[245][246]

Primary wins

Ted Cruz in Nashua, New Hampshire, on April 17, 2015

In the 2016 Republican presidential primaries, Cruz received over 7.8 million votes,[247][248] won 12 states, and earned 559 delegates.[249] He raised nearly $92 million, a record for a Republican primary candidate, much of it from small online donors. The Cruz campaign had more than 325,000 volunteers.[250]

On February 1, 2016, Cruz won the Iowa caucuses.[251] The Iowa win made him the first Hispanic to win either a presidential primary election or caucus.[251][252][253] He received 28% of the vote.[253] On February 10, Cruz placed third in the New Hampshire primary, with about 12% of the vote.[254] On February 21, he placed third in the South Carolina Republican primary with about 22.3% of the vote.[255]

On March 1, 2016, Super Tuesday, Cruz won Texas by 17%, along with Alaska and Oklahoma, providing him with four state primary victories total.[256] In the Texas primary, he received the most votes in all but six of the state's 254 counties.[257] On March 5, Cruz won the Kansas and Maine caucuses, giving him six statewide wins.[258][259][260]

Cruz won his widest margin up to that point in Kansas, where he beat front-runner Donald Trump by 25 points.[261] With his victories over Trump in Texas, Kansas, and Maine, he established himself as the candidate with the best opportunity to defeat Trump, the leading contender for the nomination.[262][263]

On March 8, 2016, Cruz won the Idaho primary with 45% of vote—defeating Trump by 17% and earning his seventh statewide victory.[264] He placed second in Michigan, Mississippi, and Hawaii.[264] On March 12, Cruz won the Wyoming county conventions with 67% of the vote and 9 delegates, giving him his eighth statewide win.[265] On March 22, Cruz won the Utah Caucus with 69.2% of the vote, versus John Kasich with 16.8% and Trump with 14%.[266] Because he surpassed the 50% winner-take-all threshold, he won all 40 of Utah's delegates. This win was his ninth. On April 3, North Dakota elected a slate of delegates dominated by pro-Cruz delegates. Cruz received the support of the majority of the delegates.[267]

On April 6, 2016, Cruz won the Wisconsin primary with 48.2% of the vote to Trump's 35.1%. It was Cruz's tenth statewide win. He won 36 of the 42 delegates available in Wisconsin. Trump received the other six. On April 2 and 7–9, Cruz swept the Colorado congressional district and state conventions, taking all 34 delegates.[268][269][270][271] This gave Cruz his 11th state win. On April 16, Cruz won all 14 of Wyoming's at-large delegates in the state convention. This secured the majority of state delegates, giving Cruz his 12th state win.[272] On April 27, he said that, if he were selected as the party's nominee, he would choose former CEO of HP and fellow 2016 Republican presidential candidate Carly Fiorina as his vice-presidential running mate.[273] Shortly after losing overwhelmingly to Trump in the Indiana primary on May 3, Cruz suspended his campaign.[274]

Citizenship

Cruz has said that when he was a child, his mother told him that she would have to formally request Canadian citizenship for him, so he and his family had always assumed he was not a Canadian citizen.[275] In August 2013, after the Dallas Morning News pointed out that he had dual Canadian-American citizenship,[276][277] he applied to formally renounce his Canadian citizenship and ceased being a citizen of Canada on May 14, 2014.[275][278]

Several lawsuits and ballot challenges asserting that Cruz was ineligible to become U.S. president were filed at the time.[279][280][281][282][283][284][285] None were successful, and in February 2016, the Illinois Board of Elections ruled in Cruz's favor, stating, ""The candidate is a natural born citizen by virtue of being born in Canada to his mother who was a U.S. citizen at the time of his birth.""[286]

After candidacy

Cruz at the 2016 Republican National Convention, July 20, 2016

Shortly after the campaign's end, Cruz indicated that he would restart the bid if successful in the Nebraska primary,[287] which Trump later won.[288]

In the months following, several publications noted that Cruz still had not endorsed Trump,[289][290] Cruz explaining in June that he was ""watching and assessing"" to determine if he would support him in the forthcoming general election.[291] On July 7, after a meeting with Trump, he confirmed that he would speak at the 2016 Republican National Convention.[292]

In his speech on July 20, the third day of the convention, Cruz congratulated Trump but did not endorse him. He instead told listeners to ""vote your conscience, vote for candidates up and down the ticket who you trust to defend our freedom and to be faithful to the Constitution"". The speech was met with boos and a negative reception among the crowd.[293] The following day at the Texas Republican delegation breakfast, Cruz defended his choice to not endorse Trump: ""I am not in the habit of supporting people who attack my wife and attack my father. That pledge was not a blanket commitment that if you go and slander and attack Heidi, that I'm going to nonetheless come like a servile puppy dog and say, 'Thank you very much for maligning my wife and maligning my father.'""[294][295] On September 23, 2016, he publicly endorsed Trump for president.[296]

On October 10, after the 2005 audio recording of Trump was released and several Republicans retracted their endorsements, Cruz reaffirmed his support, calling Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton ""manifestly unfit to be president"".[297] On November 15, he met with President-elect Trump at Trump Tower in New York City. It had been reported that Trump was considering Cruz for the position of U.S. Attorney General, but the position went to Alabama Senator Jeff Sessions.[298] On November 28, in light of Trump showing a softer tone on his campaign promises, Cruz warned that justified backlash could ensue if he strayed from them.[299]

Cruz was backed by the billionaire Mercer family, including Robert and his daughter Rebekah.[300]

Political positions

Cruz has been characterized as staunchly conservative, ""radical right"", a religious conservative, and anti-establishmentarian.[81][301][302][303]

Communism

Cruz is a critic of the rapprochement between Cuba and the United States, saying on Fox News in December 2014 that the thaw in relations was a ""manifestation of the failures of the Obama-Clinton-Kerry foreign policy"" that ""will be remembered as a tragic mistake"".[304]

In July 2018, Cruz spoke at the Rally for Religious Freedom in Asia. He said, ""It is a pleasure to be here and stand in solidarity for the men and women across this globe who have been persecuted by communists... We must stand united, in shining light, in highlighting heroism, in highlighting courage, in speaking out for those like my family, like so many millions across the globe who've seen the jackboot of communism firsthand.""[305]

Crime, guns, and drug policy

Cruz has called for an end to ""overcriminalization, harsh mandatory minimum sentences, and the demise of jury trials"".[306] He supports the death penalty.[307] In his 2012 Senate campaign, Cruz frequently mentioned his role as counsel for the State of Texas in Medellín v. Texas, a 2008 case in which the U.S. Supreme Court held that Texas has the right to ignore an order from the International Court of Justice directing the U.S. to review the convictions and sentences of dozens of Mexican nationals on death row.[308] He has called Medellín the most important case of his tenure as Texas solicitor general.[308]

Cruz is a gun rights supporter,[309] and opposes expanding gun control regulations.[310]

In an interview with radio host Hugh Hewitt discussing the attack that killed three people at a Planned Parenthood clinic in Colorado Springs, Cruz said that ""the simple and undeniable fact is the overwhelming majority of violent criminals are Democrats"", and claimed that Democrats are ""soft on crime"" because ""convicted felons tend to vote Democratic.""[311]

In August 2015, in the wake of the ambush death of a Texas police officer who was gunned down while filling up at a gas station, Cruz said that police are ""feeling the assault from the President, from the top on down, as we see—whether it's in Ferguson or Baltimore, the response from senior officials, the President or the Attorney General, is to vilify law enforcement. That's wrong. It's fundamentally wrong. It's endangering all of our safety and security.""[312]

Cruz met with gun control advocates Alyssa Milano and Fred Guttenberg to discuss gun violence in the United States. Guttenberg said this was ""a really important day"".[313]

In May 2022, after the Robb Elementary School shooting, Cruz blamed mass shootings on declining church attendance, violent video games, prescription drugs, cyberbullying, social isolation, and other societal factors.[314] He voted against the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, a gun reform bill introduced after the Robb Elementary School shooting. The bill enhanced background checks for firearm purchasers under 21, provided funding for school-based mental health services, and partially closed the gun show loophole and boyfriend loophole.[315][316]

Cruz and President Donald Trump, after signing the NASA Transition Authorization Act of 2017

Cruz opposes legalizing cannabis, but believes it should be decided at the state level.[317] After Colorado legalized cannabis, he said, ""If the citizens of Colorado decide they want to go down that road, that's their prerogative. I personally don't agree with it, but that's their right.""[318]

Economy

Cruz has been described by the Cato Institute's Center for Trade Policy Studies as a ""free trader""[319] and as a ""free-trade advocate"" by The Wall Street Journal.[320] In 2013, he proposed the abolition of the IRS and the implementation of a flat tax ""where the average American can fill out taxes on a postcard"".[321] Cruz is ""adamantly opposed to a higher minimum wage"".[322]

Cruz wants to decrease the size of the government significantly. In addition to eliminating the IRS as described above, he has promised to eliminate four other cabinet-level agencies: the Department of Energy, Department of Education, Department of Commerce, and Department of Housing and Urban Development.[323]

Cruz voted against the Inflation Reduction Act in 2022.[324]

Cruz was among the 31 Senate Republicans who voted against final passage of the Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023.[325]

Education

Cruz is a proponent of school choice[326] and opposes the Common Core State Standards Initiative.[327]

Energy and environment

Cruz rejects the scientific consensus on climate change.[328][329] In March 2015, he said that some people are ""global warming alarmists"" and, citing satellite temperature measurements, said, contrary to NASA's analysis, that there had been no significant warming in 18 years.[329][330][331]

Cruz voted against the Water Resources Development Act of 2013 that would have created the National Endowment for the Oceans and authorized more than $26 billion in projects to be built by the Army Corps of Engineers, at least $16 billion of which would have come from federal taxpayers.[332][333] He voted against the bill because it neglected ""to reduce a substantial backlog of projects, to the detriment of projects with national implications, such as the Sabine–Neches Waterway"".[334] Cruz said the Corps' responsibilities were expanded without providing adequate measures for state participation.[334] Proponents of the bill argued that it would provide steady funding to support research and restoration projects, funded primarily by dedicating 12.5% of revenues from offshore energy development, including oil, gas, and renewable energy, through offshore lease sales and production based royalty payments, distributed through a competitive grant program.[335]

In 2017, Cruz was one of 22 senators to sign a letter[336] addressed to Trump urging him to withdraw from the Paris Agreement. According to OpenSecrets, Cruz has received more than $2.5 million in campaign contributions from oil, gas and coal interests since 2012.[337] He has a lifetime score of 3% on the National Environmental Scorecard of the League of Conservation Voters.[338]

Cruz is a supporter of TransCanada's Keystone XL Pipeline,[339] and following the Republican senate whip, was a cosponsor of legislation in support of the pipeline.[340]

Federal Reserve

In a 2014 opinion editorial in USA Today, Cruz wrote that auditing the Federal Reserve System was a top Republican priority in 2015 and that he supported legislation that would allow the Government Accountability Office to evaluate the Federal Reserve's monetary policy. Federal Reserve chairwoman Janet Yellen, whose confirmation Cruz tried to prevent, said in her confirmation hearing that she opposed any audit of the Federal Reserve and that ""for 50 years Congress has recognized that there should be an exception to GAO ability to audit the Fed to avoid any political interference in monetary policy.""[341][342]

Foreign affairs

Cruz attended the opening of the US Embassy to Israel in Jerusalem in May 2018.

In 2015, Cruz voted for the USA Freedom Act, which reauthorized the USA Patriot Act but reformed some of its provisions.[343][344]

Iran

Cruz has been an adamant opponent of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, a 2015 international nuclear agreement with Iran negotiated by the U.S. and other world powers, calling it ""catastrophic"" and ""disastrous"".[345][346]

In March 2023, Cruz voted against repealing the Authorization for Use of Military Force (AUMF) in Iraq.[347]

Syria

In 2013, Cruz said that the U.S. had no ""dog in the fight"" during the Syrian Civil War and that its armed forces should not serve as ""al-Qaeda's air force"".[348] In 2014, he criticized the Obama administration: ""The president's foreign policy team utterly missed the threat of ISIS, indeed, was working to arm Syrian rebels that were fighting side by side with ISIS"", calling ISIS ""the face of evil"". In a statement opposing U.S. intervention for regime change in Syria, Cruz said, ""If President Obama and Hillary Clinton and Sen. Rubio succeed in toppling [Syrian President Bashar] Assad, the result will be the radical Islamic terrorists will take over Syria, that Syria will be controlled by ISIS, and that is materially worse for U.S. national security interests.""[349]

In September 2016, Cruz backed the Obama administration's plan to sell more than $1.15 billion worth of weapons to Saudi Arabia.[350]

On January 5, 2017, Cruz voted in favor of a House resolution condemning UN Security Council Resolution 2334, which condemned Israeli settlement building in the occupied Palestinian territories as a violation of international law.[351]

In June 2017, Cruz co-sponsored the Israel Anti-Boycott Act (s. 720), which would make it a federal crime for Americans to encourage or participate in boycotts against Israel and Israeli settlements in the West Bank if protesting actions by the Israeli government.[352][353]

Cruz with President Trump and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi in September 2019

Cruz with British Foreign Secretary David Cameron in December 2023

Cruz has called the Nord Stream II natural gas pipeline a threat to the security of Europe and the U.S. In December 2019 he and Senator Ron Johnson wrote a letter to Edward Heerema, the owner of the offshore pipe layer Allseas, to warn him of sanctions if Allseas did not suspend its work on the pipeline, which would deliver natural gas from Russia to Germany.[354] A few days later Allseas suspended the work.[355] In December 2020, the Russian pipelaying ship Akademik Cherskiy continued pipelaying.[356] In January, another pipelayer, Fortuna, joined forces with the Akademik Cherskiy to complete the pipeline.[357] On June 4, 2021, Putin announced that the pipelaying for first line of the Nord Stream 2 was fully completed. On June 10, the pipeline's sections were connected.[358] The laying of the second line was completed in September 2021.[359]

A co-sponsor of the resolution to commemorate the Armenian genocide, Cruz said that while Turkey is a NATO ally, ""We should never be afraid to tell the truth, and alliances grounded in lies are themselves unsustainable.""[360]

China

Cruz has been a consistent critic of China. In early January 2017, Cruz, Texas Governor Greg Abbott and some others met with Taiwanese president Tsai Ing-wen. Cruz criticized the People's Republic of China after it reportedly made a statement asking members of Congress not to meet with Tsai.[361][362][363]

In August 2018, Cruz and 16 other lawmakers urged the Trump administration to impose sanctions under the Global Magnitsky Act against Chinese officials responsible for human rights abuses against the Uyghur Muslim minority in western China's Xinjiang region.[364] They wrote, ""The detention of as many as a million or more Uyghurs and other predominantly Muslim ethnic minorities in 'political reeducation' centers or camps requires a tough, targeted, and global response.""[365]

American video game company Activision Blizzard punished a Hong Kong-based professional gamer for supporting pro-democracy Hong Kong protests. Cruz accused Blizzard and Apple of censorship.[366] He co-signed a letter to Activision Blizzard CEO Bobby Kotick that read, ""As China amplifies its campaign of intimidation, you and your company must decide whether to look beyond the bottom line and promote American values—like freedom of speech and thought—or to give in to Beijing's demands to preserve market access.""[367]

On July 13, 2020, the Chinese government sanctioned Cruz and three other U.S. politicians for ""interfering in China’s internal affairs"" by condemning human rights abuses in Xinjiang.[368] On August 10, 2020, the Chinese government sanctioned Cruz and 10 other Americans for ""behaving badly on Hong Kong-related issues"".[369]

In 2022, Cruz sharply criticized the Chinese government for its detention of Houston resident Mark Swidan, who had been held for over ten years. The United Nations and U.S. government considered Swidan wrongfully detained. He was released in 2024.[370]

Beginning during his time as a Dublin, California, city councilman, Eric Swalwell was targeted by a Chinese woman believed to be a clandestine officer of China's Ministry of State Security. Swalwell's general relationship with a suspected Chinese agent, Christine Fang, has been characterized as problematic, particularly given his high-profile role as a member of the House Intelligence Committee.[371] Cruz tweeted, ""More than once, I've said 'screw the Chinese communists'. Little did I know how closely Swalwell was listening.""[372]

Australia

In October 2021, Cruz posted a tweet that was critical of Australia's Northern Territory's vaccine mandates.[373] Chief Minister of the Northern Territory Michael Gunner's response to the tweet went viral quickly, garnering near universal support from Australians.[374][375][376][377]

Hate crimes

Cruz was one of six Republican senators to vote against expanding the COVID-19 Hate Crimes Act, which would allow the U.S. Justice Department to review hate crimes related to COVID-19 and establish an online database.[378][379]

Health care

Cruz questions US Customs and Border Protection leaders on COVID-19 preparedness in March 2020.

Cruz was a vocal critic of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act passed under President Obama in 2010. During the first year of Trump's presidency, Cruz sponsored legislation to repeal the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, and was part of the group of 13 senators that drafted the unsuccessful 2017 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act replacement proposals of the AHCA.[380][381][382][383]

Hurricane aid

In 2013, Cruz voted against a bill to provide a package of federal aid to the Northern East Coast for recovery from Hurricane Sandy[384] because, he said, the bill was ""filled with unrelated pork"" and ""two-thirds of that bill had nothing to do with Sandy"". The Washington Post disputed this, writing that ""the bill was largely aimed at dealing with Sandy, along with relatively minor items to address other or future disasters.""[385] The New York Times wrote that ""of 23 examples of extraneous spending that a spokesman for Mr. Cruz provided, all but one—$195 million in discretionary funds for the secretary of health and human services—were Sandy-related or sought to mitigate future storms, as the law required.""[386]

In 2015, in the wake of severe flooding in Texas, Cruz supported federal aid funding; and in 2017, called for federal intervention as Hurricane Harvey approached the coast of Texas.[387]

Immigration

Cruz took a ""hard-line stance"" on immigration issues during the 2014 border crisis[388] and opposes comprehensive immigration reform.[50][388] He advocates an increase from 65,000 to 325,000 annually in skilled foreign workers entering the United States using H-1B visas.[389] According to McClatchy, Cruz staked out ""hard-right immigration stances"" during his 2016 presidential campaign.[390]

Cruz opposes paths to citizenship for undocumented immigrants brought to the United States as children (DREAMers).[391] In February 2018, he was the sole senator to oppose a Republican motion to begin debate on legislation intended to resolve the question of what to do with DREAMers.[392] He has called for the repeal of the clause of the 14th amendment that grants citizenship to those born in the United States.[393] He defends the Trump administration's policy of separating migrant children from their parents,[394][395] blaming the migrant parents for crossing the U.S. border to seek asylum and claiming that the Obama administration maintained a similar policy.[394][395]

In December 2020, Cruz blocked the Hong Kong People's Freedom and Choice Act, which would give Hong Kongers refugee status, citing the threat of spying by China. He said the law was an attempt by Democrats ""to advance their long-standing goals on changing immigration laws"".[396]

During a May 2021 Senate Rules Committee hearing, Cruz falsely asserted that House Democrats had ""designed"" the For The People Act such that it ""directs"" people ""to break the law and register millions of people to vote who are not eligible to vote because they are not United States citizens"" and ""automatically registers to vote anyone who interacts with the government"" regardless of their immigration status. The bill repeatedly states only U.S. citizens would be permitted to register.[397]

In September 2024, Cruz tweeted an image macro of two cats hugging with captions that reiterated a false claim by Donald Trump that Haitian immigrants steal and eat American citizens' pets.[398][399] Twitter users condemned Cruz for perpetuating a racist hoax, with some citing his Cancún controversy to doubt the authenticity of his concern for the safety of Americans' pets.[400][401]

Judiciary

Ted Cruz and Judge Brett Kavanaugh in July 2018

In March 2016, about seven months before the forthcoming presidential election, Cruz argued the Senate should not consider Obama's nominee to the Supreme Court on the grounds that ""this should be a decision for the people. Let the election decide. If the Democrats want to replace this nominee, they need to win the election"". In September 2020, less than two months before the next presidential election, Cruz supported an immediate vote on Trump's nominee to fill the Supreme Court vacancy caused by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg's death.[402]

During Donald Trump's presidency, Cruz and fellow Texas Senator John Cornyn contributed to the appointment of multiple conservative judges to federal courts with jurisdiction over Texas.[403][404][405][406]

Military

Cruz has criticized the U.S. military for becoming ""emasculated"" by its recruiting efforts, comparing those efforts unfavorably to the Russian military's.[407][408] He accused Democratic politicians of trying to transform ""the greatest military on earth"" into ""pansies"".[407] He has claimed the military is debilitated and its ""ability to project power and obtain air superiority is tragically anemic"".[409] Blaming ""bloated bureaucracy and social experiments"", Cruz has proposed reducing the size of the active duty military while increasing spending.[410]

Net neutrality and social media

Cruz opposes net neutrality—which prevents Internet service providers from deliberately blocking or slowing particular websites—arguing that the Internet economy has flourished in the United States simply because it has remained largely free from government regulation.[411] He has argued that net neutrality is the ""Obamacare for the internet"".[412][413] Cruz said that the Obama-era implementation of the principle of net neutrality had the ""end result"" of ""less broadband, less innovation, and less freedom for the American consumer"".[413] In December 2017, after the Republican-controlled Federal Communications Commission repealed net neutrality, he mocked supporters of net neutrality as ""snowflakes"" who were misled by ""online propaganda"".[414]

In January 2025, Cruz and Senators Chris Murphy, Katie Britt, and Brian Schatz introduced the Kids Off Social Media Act (KOSMA). Senators John Curtis, Peter Welch, John Fetterman, Ted Budd, Mark Warner, and Angus King also co-sponsored the Act,[415] which would set a minimum age of 13 to use social media platforms and prevent social media companies from feeding ""algorithmically targeted"" content to users under 17. Cruz said: ""Every parent I know is concerned about the online threats to kids—from predators to videos promoting self-harm, risky behavior, or low self-esteem. Many families have suffered due to Big Tech's failure to take responsibility for its products. The Kids Off Social Media Act addresses these issues by supporting families in crisis and empowering teachers to better manage their classrooms"".[416][417][418]

Outsourcing of jobs

During his 2016 presidential campaign, Cruz strongly denounced outsourcing American jobs to other countries, alleging that any politician who allowed it to happen was betraying their constituents. He pinned some of his blame on then-President Obama, saying that Obama had overseen outsourcing for the previous seven years. Cruz's denunciation of Obama was criticized by PolitiFact, which found that the modern pattern of American outsourcing, while prevalent during the Obama years, had started earlier.[419] During the campaign, one of Cruz's promises was to return manufacturing jobs to the U.S. His choice of running mate, Carly Fiorina, was met with pushback due to her record of outsourcing, but he defended her.[420] In 2022, Cruz voted against Bernie Sanders's proposed measure for the United States Innovation and Competition Act, which promised to fund semiconductor manufacturers amid a shortage of their products during the COVID-19 pandemic. The measure would block semiconductor manufacturers funded by the bill from outsourcing their jobs and forbid them to dissuade their employees from forming unions.[421][422]

Social issues

Cruz is strongly anti-abortion, but ""would allow the procedure...when a pregnancy endangers the mother's life"".[423][424] He is in favor of cutting federal funding to Planned Parenthood.[425] Cruz opposes both same-sex marriage and civil unions.[426] In 2013, he said he wanted marriage to be legally defined as only ""between one man and one woman"",[427] but also said that the legality of same-sex marriage should be left to each state to decide.[428] In 2015, after the Supreme Court decision in Obergefell ruled same-sex marriage bans unconstitutional, he called the decision ""the very definition of tyranny"",[429] accused the court of judicial activism, and said it was ""among the darkest hours of our nation"".[430] In 2017, the same day that an audio clip resurfaced of Alabama Judge Roy Moore calling Obergefell ""worse"" than the 1857 ruling that upheld slavery, Cruz endorsed Moore for U.S. Senate.[431] He reaffirmed his position in 2022 after comments by Justice Clarence Thomas.[432] While speaking to students at a summit for Turning Point USA, an American nonprofit organization that advocates for conservative politics on high school, college, and university campuses, Cruz joked that his favored personal pronoun is ""kiss my ass"".[433] In 2022, Cruz voted against the Respect for Marriage Act.[434] In July 2022, Cruz issued a press release saying that he supported the repeal of the 1845 Texas anti-sodomy law, writing, ""consenting adults should be able to do what they wish in their private sexual activity, and the government has no business in their bedrooms.""[435][436] Cruz compared the vandalism and destruction of monuments and memorials in the United States to the 2001 destruction of the giant Buddhas of Bamiyan by the Taliban.[437]

Podcast

Cruz and Michael J. Knowles started a podcast, Verdict with Ted Cruz, on January 21, 2020. The first episodes were summaries of the impeachment hearings of Donald Trump. After the hearings ended the podcast expanded its content to include other topics and interviews, including with Washington politicians such as U.S. Senators Tim Scott, Lindsey Graham, and Mike Lee, Trump administration officials including White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows, then-U.S. Attorney General Bill Barr, U.S. Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos, and actors Jon Voight and Isaiah Washington.[438]

In October 2022, Verdict with Ted Cruz picked up corporate partner iHeartRadio. The podcast also expanded to three times a week and Ben Ferguson replaced Knowles as co-host.[439]

Staying at his home in Texas,[448] he avoided contact with colleagues and constituents for 14 days. Cruz said he had been advised that the odds of contracting the virus were very low.[449] In 2023, he cameoed in The Daily Wire comedy film Lady Ballers.[450]

He completed Naval Justice School in 2005. Later that year, he reported to the JAG Trial Service Office Command South East at Naval Station Mayport, Florida, as a prosecutor. He was promoted from lieutenant, junior grade to lieutenant in 2006.

In the spring of 2006, DeSantis arrived at Joint Task Force Guantanamo (JTF-GTMO), working with detainees at the Guantanamo Bay detention camp.[31][32][33] The publicly released records of his service in the Navy were redacted, with the Navy citing a personal-privacy exception to the Freedom of Information Act.[34] Mansur Ahmad Saad al-Dayfi, who was held at Guantanamo, alleged in 2022 that DeSantis oversaw force-feeding detainees[35][36][37][38][33] and DeSantis acknowledged that he advised the commander of the base about the use of force feeding.[39]

In 2007, DeSantis reported to the Naval Special Warfare Command Group in Coronado, California, where he was assigned as a legal adviser to SEAL Team One; he deployed to Iraq in the fall of 2007 as part of the troop surge.[40][41] He served as legal adviser to Dane Thorleifson, the SEAL Commander of the Special Operations Task Force-West in Fallujah.[31][32]

U.S. House of Representatives (2013–2018)

Elections

During his campaign, he aligned himself with the conservative Tea Party movement.[46] His campaign was financially supported by the Koch Brothers' organizations FreedomWorks and Club for Growth. U.S. senator Mike Lee and former United Nations ambassador John Bolton helped DeSantis campaign and raise money.[46][47] In August, DeSantis defeated six candidates in the Republican primary[48] and then defeated Democratic nominee Heather Beaven in the November general election.[49] He was reelected in 2014[50] and 2016.[51]

In May 2015, DeSantis announced his candidacy for the 2016 United States Senate election in Florida. He ran for the seat held by Marco Rubio, who initially did not file to run for reelection due to his 2016 presidential campaign.[52] DeSantis was endorsed by the Koch Brothers' fiscally conservative Club for Growth, which had previously supported his U.S. House campaign.[53] When Rubio ended his presidential bid and ran for reelection to the Senate, DeSantis withdrew from the Senate race, instead running for reelection to the House.[54]

Tenure

DeSantis speaking at the Hudson Institute in June 2015

DeSantis signed a 2013 ""No Climate Tax Pledge"" against any tax hikes to fight global warming.[55] He voted in favor of H.R. 45, which would have repealed the Affordable Care Act in 2013.[56] DeSantis introduced a bill in 2014 that would have required the Justice Department to report to Congress whenever any federal agency refrained from enforcing laws.[57][58][59] In 2015, DeSantis was a founding member of the Freedom Caucus, a group of congressional conservatives and libertarians.[32][60][61]

DeSantis opposes gun control and received repeated ""A"" ratings from the NRA Political Victory Fund.[62][63] He has said, ""Very rarely do firearms restrictions affect criminals. They really only affect law-abiding citizens.""[64]

DeSantis was a critic of Obama's immigration policies, including deferred action legislation (DACA and DAPA), accusing Obama of failing to enforce immigration laws.[65] In 2015 he co-sponsored Kate's Law, which would have increased penalties for aliens who unlawfully reenter the U.S. after being removed.[66] DeSantis encouraged Florida sheriffs to cooperate with the federal government on immigration-related issues.[67]

In 2016, DeSantis introduced the Higher Education Reform and Opportunity Act, which would have allowed states to create their own accreditation systems. He said this legislation would also give students ""access to federal loan money to put towards non-traditional educational opportunities, such as online learning courses, vocational schools, and apprenticeships in skilled trades"".[68]

In 2016, DeSantis received a ""0"" rating from the Human Rights Campaign on LGBT-related legislation.[69][70] Two years later, he told the Sun Sentinel that he ""doesn't want any discrimination in Florida, I want people to be able to live their life, whether you're gay or whether you're religious.""[71]

DeSantis was present before the June 2017 congressional baseball shooting, and the perpetrator asked him whether the players were Republicans.[72] Later that summer, DeSantis proposed legislation that would have ended funding by November of that year for the Mueller investigation of President Trump.[73] He said that the May 17, 2017, order that initiated the probe ""didn't identify a crime to be investigated"" and was likely to start a fishing expedition.[74][75]

DeSantis supports a constitutional amendment to impose term limits on members of Congress, so that U.S. representatives would be limited to three terms and senators to two.[76] He served three terms in the House of Representatives, retiring in 2018 to run for governor of Florida.[77]

Fiscal policy

DeSantis said that the debate over how to reduce the federal deficit should shift emphasis from tax increases to curtailing spending and triggering economic growth.[78] He is a past supporter of replacing the federal income tax and the IRS with a federal sales tax called the FairTax, by cosponsoring legislation to do so as a U.S. representative.[79][80] He supported a ""no budget, no pay"" policy for Congress to encourage passage of a budget resolution.[81] DeSantis endorsed the REINS Act, which would have required that regulations significantly affecting the economy be subject to a vote of Congress before taking effect.[82] He also supported auditing the Federal Reserve System.[83]

DeSantis supported the 2014 Venezuelan protests, calling them peaceful and a result of Venezuela's ""socialist"" economic policy. He heavily criticized the Venezuelan government's response to the protests, saying its actions resembled techniques used by Cuban leader Fidel Castro.[84] For alleged IRS targeting of conservatives, DeSantis asked for IRS commissioner John Koskinen's resignation for having ""failed the American people by frustrating Congress's attempts to ascertain the truth.""[85][86] He cosponsored a bill to impeach Koskinen for violating the public's trust.[87] DeSantis criticized IRS employee Lois Lerner and asked that she testify to Congress.[88]

In 2014, DeSantis introduced the Let Seniors Work Act, the companion of a similar bill introduced by Marco Rubio in the Senate.[89] The bill would have repealed an incentive to retire instead of keep working and would have exempted those above 65 from the 12.4% Social Security payroll tax; he also cosponsored a measure to eliminate taxes on Social Security benefits.[90][91] According to PolitiFact, it is ""half true"" that DeSantis voted to cut Social Security and Medicare and voted to increase the retirement age, because those votes were on non-binding resolutions that would not have become law even if passed, and because the objective was to stabilize those social programs to avoid steeper cuts later.[92][93]

Conservative think tank Citizens Against Government Waste named DeSantis a ""Taxpayer Superhero"" in 2015.[94] DeSantis sponsored the Transportation Empowerment Act, which would have transferred much of the responsibility for transportation projects to the states and sharply reduced the federal gas tax.[95] He opposed legislation to require online retailers to collect and pay state sales tax.[96] He voted for the 2017 Trump tax cuts.[97][98]

DeSantis opted not to receive his congressional pension and filed a measure that would eliminate pensions for members of Congress.[83][99]

Committees

During the 114th United States Congress, DeSantis served on the Committee on Oversight and Accountability, and chaired its Subcommittee on National Security.[100] He also served on the Foreign Affairs Committee, Judiciary Committee, and the Republican Study Committee, along with several subcommittees of those.[101]

Gubernatorial campaigns

DeSantis was elected governor of Florida in 2018 and reelected in 2022. He is not eligible to run for a third term in 2026.[102]

2018 candidacy

2018 election results map by county

DeSantis: 50–60% 60–70% 70–80% 80–90%

Gillum: 50–60% 60–70%

On January 5, 2018, DeSantis filed to run for the office of governor to replace term-limited Republican incumbent Rick Scott.[103] President Trump had said the previous month that he would support DeSantis should he run for governor.[104] During the Republican primary, DeSantis emphasized his support for Trump by running an ad in which DeSantis taught his children how to ""build the wall"" and say ""Make America Great Again"".[105] Asked whether he could name an issue on which he disagreed with Trump, DeSantis declined.[106] On August 28, 2018, DeSantis won the Republican primary, defeating his main opponent, Adam Putnam.[107]

DeSantis's gubernatorial platform included support for legislation that would allow people with concealed weapons permits to carry firearms openly.[108] He also supported a law mandating the use of E-Verify by businesses and a state-level ban on sanctuary city protections for undocumented immigrants.[108] DeSantis promised to stop the spread of polluted water from Lake Okeechobee.[108] He expressed support for a state constitutional amendment to require a supermajority vote for any tax increases.[109] DeSantis opposed allowing able-bodied, childless adults to receive Medicaid.[109] He said he would implement a medical cannabis program, while opposing the legalization of recreational cannabis.[109][110][111]

The day after his primary win, in a televised Fox News interview, DeSantis said, ""The last thing we need to do is to monkey this up by trying to embrace a socialist agenda with huge tax increases and bankrupting the state."" His use of the word ""monkey"" received widespread media attention, and was interpreted by some, including Florida Democratic Party chair Terrie Rizzo, as a racist dog whistle alluding to the Democratic gubernatorial nominee, Andrew Gillum, who is African-American.[112][113][114][115] DeSantis denied the racism charge.[116][117][118][119] Dexter Filkins, writing in The New Yorker in 2022, called it a ""disastrous gaffe,"" and quoted an unnamed ally of DeSantis lamenting that afterward, ""We were handling Gillum with kid gloves. We can't hit the guy, because we're trying to defend the fact that we're not racist.""[116]

The general election was ""widely seen as a toss-up.""[120] Some sheriffs endorsed DeSantis, while other sheriffs backed Gillum.[121] DeSantis was endorsed by the Florida Police Chiefs Association.[122] On September 5, he announced state representative Jeanette Núñez as his running mate.[123] He resigned his House seat on September 10 to focus on his gubernatorial campaign.[124] The same month, he canceled a planned interview with the Tampa Bay Times to have additional time to put together a platform before an in-depth policy interview.[125] On election night, initial results had DeSantis winning, and so Gillum conceded.[126] Gillum rescinded his concession when the margin narrowed to 0.4 percent, and an automatic machine recount began with a November 15 deadline.[127] Although three counties missed the deadline, it was not extended.[128][129] DeSantis was confirmed as the winner and Gillum conceded on November 17.[130]

2022 candidacy

2022 election results map by county

DeSantis: 50–60% 60–70% 70–80% 80–90% >90%

Crist: 50–60% 60–70%

In September 2021, DeSantis announced he would run for reelection.[131] On November 7, he filed the necessary paperwork to officially enter the race.[132] In the general election, he faced Democratic nominee Charlie Crist, a U.S. representative and former Florida governor.[133] Crist heavily criticized DeSantis's decision to transport illegal immigrants to Democratic states, arguing that it was human rights abuse.[134] During an interview with Bret Baier on Fox News, Crist called DeSantis ""one of the biggest threats to democracy"".[135]

The gubernatorial debate was held on October 23, and the candidates exchanged attacks. At one point, Crist asked DeSantis whether he would serve a full four-year term, in relation to talk about a potential DeSantis campaign for president in 2024. DeSantis responded, ""the only worn-out old donkey I'm looking to put out to pastures is Charlie Crist"".[136] On the campaign trail DeSantis criticized Crist's role as a U.S. representative, and at the debate said that Crist showed up for work for only 14 days during 2022.[137]

DeSantis won the November 8 election in a landslide,[138] with 59.4 percent of the vote to Crist's 40 percent; it was the largest margin of victory in a Florida gubernatorial election since 1982.[139] Significantly, DeSantis won Miami-Dade County, which had been considered a Democratic stronghold and had last voted Republican in 2002, and Palm Beach County, which had not voted Republican since 1986.[140][141] Crist conceded the election shortly after DeSantis was projected as the winner.[142] At DeSantis's victory rally, supporters chanted ""two more years"" at various times rather than the common ""four more years"" to show support for DeSantis for president in 2024.[143]

Governor of Florida (2019–present)

DeSantis's official portrait during his first term as governor

DeSantis became governor of Florida on January 8, 2019.[144] Inaugurated at age 40, he was the youngest person to assume the office since Park Trammell in 1913 and the youngest Republican ever to serve in the position.[145] He has generally governed as a conservative.[146] On January 11, three days after taking office, he posthumously pardoned the Groveland Four, a group of black men falsely convicted of rape in 1949.[147][148] The same day,[149] he officially suspended Broward County sheriff Scott Israel, ostensibly for his responses to the mass shootings at the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, appointing Gregory Tony to replace him.[150][151] In its 2021 session, the Florida legislature passed DeSantis's top priorities.[152][153] During his tenure, the Republican-dominated Florida Legislature enacted much of DeSantis's legislative agenda, often on rapid timelines.[154][155] Maximizing the power of the governor's office, DeSantis exerted pressure on Republican legislative leaders.[156][157]

Economic

During his 2018 gubernatorial campaign, DeSantis pledged to lower corporate income taxes to 5 percent or lower.[158] During his tenure, corporate income taxes in Florida got as low as 3.5 percent in 2021, but by 2022 they had increased to 5.5 percent.[159] DeSantis has maintained Florida's low-tax status during his time as governor.[160] In June 2019, DeSantis signed a $91.1 billion budget the legislature passed the previous month, which was the largest in state history at the time, though he cut $131 million in appropriations.[161][162] In June 2021, he signed a $101.5 billion budget; he used his line-item veto to veto $1.5 billion (of which $1 billion was in federal American Rescue Plan Act money for an emergency response fund).[163][164] The budget DeSantis signed was more than $9 billion higher than Florida's current state spending plan.[163]

During the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, DeSantis blamed former governor Rick Scott for ""revamping the state's unemployment insurance system with pointless roadblocks that he said were designed to prevent people from claiming benefits"", saying it created massive backlogs earlier in the year as the pandemic decimated the economy.[165] Afterward, Florida's economy swiftly started recovering, and the unemployment rate fell below 7 percent by the latter half of 2020.[166] In December 2020, DeSantis ordered the Florida Department of Economic Opportunity to extend unemployment waivers until February 27, 2021.[167] By the end of 2020, the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank, graded DeSantis ""B"" in its biennial fiscal policy report on America's governors.[168] Since May 2022, Florida's unemployment rate has sat around two percent, below the national average.[169]

On November 22, 2021, because of a significant increase in gasoline prices, DeSantis announced that he would temporarily waive Florida's gasoline tax in the next legislative session, in 2022.[170] Florida had a record state budget surplus in 2023.[171]

While in Congress, DeSantis supported proposals to raise the retirement age (i.e., the age to qualify for Medicare and Social Security) to 70 and to privatize Medicare, turning it into a ""premium support"" system.[93][172][92] While running for president in 2023, DeSantis reversed his position, saying, ""we’re not going to mess with Social Security.""[93][172][92]

Education

In June 2021, DeSantis led an effort to ban the teaching of critical race theory in Florida public schools (though it had not been part of Florida's public school curriculum). He described critical race theory as ""teaching kids to hate their country,"" mirroring a similar push by conservatives nationally.[173] The Florida Board of Education approved the ban on June 10. The Florida Education Association criticized the ban, accusing the board of trying to hide facts from students. Other critics said the ban was an effort to ""politicize classroom education and whitewash American history"".[174][175]

On September 14, 2021, DeSantis announced that Florida would replace the Florida Standards Assessment (FSA) test with a system of three smaller tests throughout the school year, in the fall, winter and spring. The new system was implemented in the 2022–23 school year.[176]

On December 15, 2021, DeSantis announced a new bill, the Stop Wrongs to Our Kids and Employees Act (""Stop WOKE Act""), which would allow parents to sue school districts that teach critical race theory. He framed the bill as a bill to combat ""woke indoctrination"" that would ""teach our kids to hate our country or hate each other.""[177][178][179][180] On August 18, 2022, federal judge Mark E. Walker blocked enforcement of the act as applied to businesses, ruling that it violated the First Amendment and was impermissibly vague.[181] Walker later blocked enforcement of the act as applied to public universities for similar reasons, writing that the legislation is ""positively dystopian"" because it ""officially bans professors from expressing disfavored viewpoints in university classrooms while permitting unfettered expression of the opposite viewpoints.""[182]

Election law and voting rights

DeSantis expressed support for the Voting Rights Restoration for Felons Initiative after it passed in November 2018, saying he was ""obligated to faithfully implement [it] as it is defined"" when he became governor. After he refused to restore voting rights for felons with unpaid fines, which voting rights groups said was inconsistent with the referendum's results, he was challenged in court. The Florida Supreme Court sided with DeSantis on the issue,[183] and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit also sided with DeSantis in a 6–4 ruling.[184]

In April 2019, DeSantis directed Florida's elections chief to expand the availability of Spanish-language ballots and Spanish assistance for voters. In a statement, DeSantis said, ""It is critically important that Spanish-speaking Floridians are able to exercise their right to vote without any language barriers.""[185]

In June 2019, DeSantis signed a measure that would make it harder to launch successful ballot initiatives. Petition-gathering for ballot initiatives to legalize medical cannabis, increases to the minimum wage, and expansion of Medicaid were also under way.[186][187][188] DeSantis instructed Florida Attorney General Ashley Moody to investigate whether Michael Bloomberg had criminally offered incentives for felons to vote by assisting in a fundraising effort to pay off their financial obligations so they could vote in the 2020 presidential election in Florida. No wrongdoing was found.[189]

In February 2021, DeSantis announced his support for eliminating ballot drop boxes and limiting voting by mail by requiring that voters re-register every year to vote by mail and that signatures on mail-in ballots ""match the most recent signature on file"" (rather than any of the voter's signatures in the Florida system).[190][191] The changes to mail-in voting were notable given that Republicans had historically voted by mail more than Democrats, but Democrats outvoted Republicans by mail in 2020.[190] According to a Tampa Bay Times analysis, DeSantis's signature match proposal could have led to rejections of his own mail-in ballots due to changes in his signature history over time; voting rights experts argued that the signature matching proposal could be used to disenfranchise voters whose signatures varied over time.[191]

Abortion limits

After the U.S. Supreme Court decided Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization, which overturned Roe v. Wade, DeSantis pledged to ""expand pro-life protections"".[192] On April 14, 2022, he signed into law a bill that bans abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy; under the previous law, the limit had been 24 weeks.[193] The law includes exceptions for abortions beyond 15 weeks if they are necessary to avert ""serious risk"" to the pregnant woman's physical health or if there is a ""fatal fetal abnormality"" but makes no exceptions for rape, human trafficking, incest, or mental health.[194]

The law was expected to go into effect on July 1, 2022,[195] but a state judge blocked its enforcement, ruling that it violated the right to privacy guaranteed by the Florida Constitution.[196][197] After DeSantis appealed the ruling, the law went into effect on July 5, pending judicial review.[198] In January 2023, the Supreme Court of Florida agreed to hear a legal challenge to the law.[199]

In April 2023, DeSantis signed a six-week abortion ban.[200] The legislation contains exceptions allowing abortion up to 15 weeks in cases in which the pregnancy was a result of rape, incest, or human trafficking, but requires the woman to provide proof of a crime before being permitted an abortion under any of those exceptions.[201][202] The bill will make providing an abortion a felony punishable by up to five years in prison, ban telemedicine for abortion, and limit the availability of medication abortion.[203] The six-week ban went into effect on May 1, 2024, after the Supreme Court of Florida upheld the 15-week ban on April 1, 2024.[204]

Tech platforms

On February 2, 2021, DeSantis announced support for legislation to hold tech companies accountable to prevent alleged political censorship.[205][206] In response to social media networks removing Trump from their platforms, DeSantis and other Florida Republicans pushed legislation in the Florida legislature to prohibit tech companies from de-platforming political candidates.[207] A federal judge blocked the law by preliminary injunction the day before it was to take effect, on the grounds that it violated the First Amendment and federal law.[208] When Twitter suspended DeSantis administration critic Rebekah Jones's account for violating rules against spam and platform manipulation, DeSantis's office applauded the decision, calling it ""long overdue"".[209][210] DeSantis supported Elon Musk's acquisition of Twitter, believing ""it illegal for tech platforms to block or demote content that might otherwise run afoul of their terms of service"".[211]

In 2024, Desantis signed into a law a bill that requires social media platforms to prohibit people under 16 years old from making accounts. The law has been criticized by digital rights organizations like Netchoice, which said it ""forces Floridians to hand over sensitive personal information to websites or lose their access to critical information channels. This infringes on Floridians' First Amendment rights to share and access speech online"", and that ""the Supreme Court has made clear that the government lacks the 'free-floating power to restrict the ideas to which children may be exposed'"".[212]

COVID-19 response

During 2020 and 2021, scientists and media outlets initially gave mixed reviews of DeSantis's handling of the COVID-19 pandemic.[213][214][215] From March 2020 through March 22, 2023, Florida had the 12th-highest rate of cases and deaths per 100,000 people among the 50 states, Washington, D.C., and Puerto Rico, without adjusting for the age of Florida's large and vulnerable elderly population.[216][217] Florida's age-adjusted death rate, which takes its disproportionately elderly population into account, was roughly near the median among states as of 2021, and a 2022 study placed it at the nation's 12th lowest.[218][217][219] By 2023, many political scientists acknowledged that DeSantis's management of the pandemic may have benefited him in his reelection campaign, and he was credited with turning ""his coronavirus policies into a parable of American freedom"".[220][221]

LGBT rights

On June 1, 2021, DeSantis signed the Fairness in Women's Sports Act (SB 1028). It bans transgender girls and women from participating and competing in middle-school and high-school girls' and college women's sports competitions. The law took effect on July 1.[222]

In February 2022, DeSantis voiced support for the Florida Parental Rights in Education Act (HB1557), commonly known as the ""Don't Say Gay"" law, which prohibits discussion of sexual orientation or gender identity in school classrooms from kindergarten to grade 3. He said it was ""entirely inappropriate"" for teachers and school administrators to talk to students about their gender identity.[223][224][225] DeSantis signed the bill into law in March 2022, and it took effect on July 1, 2022.[226] This statute also includes a provision ""requiring school district personnel to encourage a student to discuss issues relating to his or her well-being with his or her parent or to facilitate discussion of the issue with the parent"", and does not limit such issues to sexual orientation or gender identity.[227] As of March 2023, DeSantis was considering further similar legislation for all grades.[228][229] On April 19, the state board of education extended the act's restrictions on classroom instruction to grades 4–12, unless the instruction is required by existing state standards or is part of an elective course on reproductive health.[230][231]

Dispute with Disney

The Walt Disney Company, owner of Walt Disney World in Florida, called for the law's repeal, beginning a dispute between Disney and the state government.[232] In April 2022, DeSantis signed a bill eliminating the company's special independent district act and replacing its Disney-appointed board of overseers.[233][234] He also threatened during a press conference to build a new state prison near the Disney World complex.[235] On April 26, 2023, Disney filed suit against DeSantis and several others, accusing them of retaliating against protected speech.[236] DeSantis's attorneys filed a motion to dismiss Disney's lawsuit on June 26, claiming that the governor and state legislators have ""legislative immunity"".[237] The lawsuit was dismissed on January 31, 2024, with Disney vowing to appeal.[238] On March 27, 2024, Disney settled its pending state court lawsuits with DeSantis. Per the agreement, Disney put the appeal of its federal lawsuit on hold while a new development agreement with Florida was negotiated. But no alterations to Disney's appeal of the federal lawsuit were made.[239][240][241] The settlement came a day after DeSantis replaced two Disney critics on the Central Florida Tourism Oversight District with two Disney supporters[242][243] and two weeks after a court largely overturned The Parental Rights in Education Act.[244][245]

Policing and law enforcement

DeSantis at a pro-law enforcement rally in Staten Island

DeSantis opposes efforts to defund the police, and as governor has introduced initiatives to ""fund the police"".[246] In September 2021, he introduced a $5,000 signing bonus for Florida police officers in a bid to attract out-of-state police recruits.[247]

In April 2021, DeSantis signed into law the Combating Public Disorder Act he had been advocating. Aside from being an anti-riot statute, it forbade intimidation by mobs; penalized damage to historic properties or memorials, such as downtown Miami's Christopher Columbus statue, which was damaged in 2020; and forbade publishing personal identifying information online with intent to harm.[248] DeSantis had argued for this legislation by citing the George Floyd protests of 2020 and the 2021 United States Capitol attack, although only the former was mentioned at the signing ceremony.[249] Several months after the signing, a federal judge blocked the portion of the law that introduced a new definition of ""riot"", calling it too vague.[250]

On May 5, 2021, DeSantis announced that all Florida police officers, firefighters, and paramedics would receive a $1,000 bonus.[251]

On December 2, 2021, DeSantis announced that as part of a $100 million funding proposal for the Florida National Guard, $3.5 million would be allocated to the reactivation of the Florida State Guard, a volunteer state defense force that had been inactive since 1947.[252][253]

In 2022, DeSantis signed a bill creating an election police unit to investigate election fraud.[254] At a press event in September 2024, he defended the unit's visits to the homes of Florida voters who had signed an abortion rights ballot initiative.[255]

Immigration and refugees

In June 2019, DeSantis signed an anti-""sanctuary city"" bill into law. Florida had no sanctuary cities before the law's enactment, and immigration advocates called the bill politically motivated.[256][257][258]

Florida became the 12th state to adopt legislation requiring local governments to aid federal immigration-enforcement efforts.[259] In June 2020, DeSantis signed a bill requiring government employers and contractors to use E-Verify.[260][261][262] He had originally called for all employers to be required to use it.[263] A few years later, he signed into law an expansion of E-Verify and other immigration laws.[264]

In 2021, DeSantis halted cooperation with the Biden administration's program to relocate and resettle migrants in Florida in the wake of a surge in illegal immigration.[265] DeSantis's administration also allocated $12 million for relocating migrants to other states.[266]

In September 2022, after similar actions by Texas Governor Greg Abbott, an agent of DeSantis recruited 50 newly arrived asylum seekers, mostly from Venezuela, in San Antonio, Texas, and flew them via two chartered planes to the Crestview, Florida airport, where they did not debark, then proceeded to Martha's Vineyard, Massachusetts. The migrants filed a class-action suit against DeSantis, calling his treatment of them ""extreme and outrageous, and utterly intolerable in a civilized community"".[267][268]

In May 2023, DeSantis announced plans to send over 1,000 personnel to Texas, including National Guard troops, to help Texas stem the influx of illegal immigration across the southern border.[269]

Hurricane Ian response

President Joe Biden and Governor DeSantis greet each other in Fort Myers for a briefing on response and recovery efforts after Hurricane Ian.

DeSantis was widely praised for the state's response to Hurricane Ian — the deadliest hurricane to hit Florida in 87 years.[270][271][272] In September 2022, DeSantis declared a state of emergency for all of Florida as Ian approached and asked for federal aid ahead of time.[273][274][better source needed] On October 5, after Ian deserted Florida, President Biden arrived in Florida and met with DeSantis and Senators Marco Rubio and Rick Scott.[275] DeSantis and Biden held a press conference in Fort Myers, at which Biden said DeSantis had ""done a good job"", to report on the status of the cleanup.[276] In addition, DeSantis partnered with Elon Musk, CEO of SpaceX and Tesla, Inc., to use the Starlink satellite Internet service to help restore communication across the state.[277]

Environment

DeSantis supported programs dedicated to environmental conservation and protection from flooding in Florida. At the same time, he questioned climate science, supported fossil fuels, opposed renewables, and sanctioned firms for considering environmental issues in their investments.[278]

The Inflation Reduction Act and the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act gave Florida $3.75 million for urban forests and nature, $209,000 for fighting pollution, and $78.7 million to protect the state from climate change impacts.

DeSantis refused to accept $346 million from the Inflation Reduction Act for rebates to homeowners who want to retrofit their houses, make it more energy efficient, $3 million to fight pollution, and a program to help low-income people buy solar panels, as well as $24 million from the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act for improving sewage systems in rural areas. The rebates were requested by Florida energy office and the legislature, but DeSantis vetoed them. All other governors, including Republicans, accepted the money. The money could go to local cities and authorities, and three Florida cities received some funds. Rhode Island and Kentucky requested to take Florida's money for themselves. The program should help people lower their energy bills and weatherize their houses while creating jobs. Half the money should go to low-income households.[279][280][281] Making a house more energy-efficient can cut utility bills by 25% for an average family.[282] DeSantis later reversed course and attempted to reclaim some of the rejected home energy rebate funds.[283]

In June 2024, DeSantis vetoed a bill passed by the State House that would have created a statewide process managed by the Department of Health to issue closures and send warnings if the bacteria in waterways reached unsafe levels.[284]

2024 presidential campaign

Campaign logo for DeSantis

In 2020-23, media outlets saw DeSantis as a likely candidate for the 2024 presidential election, and notable people urged him to run.[285][286] In April 2023 Trump led DeSantis in national polls for the Republican nomination, but DeSantis was performing better in battleground polling of the general election.[287][288] In a straw poll at the 2022 Conservative Political Action Conference DeSantis came in second with 28%, to Trump's 59%.[289] In 2022, DeSantis became seen as a contender for the nomination. Writers predicted he could defeat Trump or said he was preferable to Trump in view of the January 6 hearings and straw polls.[290][291][292] These ideas gained more traction after the 2022 midterm elections, when DeSantis was reelected governor by almost 20 percentage points, while Trump-endorsed candidates, such as Mehmet Oz in the Senate race in Pennsylvania, performed poorly.[293][294]

The release of DeSantis's memoir, The Courage to Be Free, and book tour, increased 2024 speculation.[295] On May 24, 2023, DeSantis officially launched his bid for president.[296] It was announced on X, then called Twitter, with assistance from its owner, Elon Musk; the launch was marred by technical glitches.[297]

On January 21, 2024, two days before the New Hampshire primary, DeSantis announced on X that he was suspending his campaign and endorsed Trump.[298] He had finished in a distant second to Trump in the Iowa caucuses the previous week.[299] DeSantis's campaign finished with nine delegates to the Republican National Convention.[300][301] Despite having already dropped out, DeSantis still had his name on the ballot in the 2024 Florida Republican presidential primary and received 3.7% of the vote.[302]

Personal life

DeSantis family in November 2022

DeSantis met his wife, Casey Black, at a golf course at the University of North Florida.[303][304] She had been a television host for the Golf Channel, and then a television journalist and news anchor at WJXT.[305][303] They married on September 26, 2009, in a chapel at Disney's Grand Floridian Resort & Spa.[303][306][307] DeSantis is Catholic, as was his wedding ceremony.[307][308]

The couple lived in Ponte Vedra Beach, near St. Augustine, until it was drawn into the neighboring 4th congressional district. They then moved to a condo owned by Kent Stermon in Palm Coast, north of Daytona Beach, which remained in the district he represented: the 6th.[309][310] They have three children.[311]

He is a member of the Veterans of Foreign Wars and the American Legion.[312] In 2022, DeSantis appeared on Time 100, Time's annual list of the 100 most influential people in the world.[313] As of September 2023 , his net worth was estimated at $1.5 million, up from $300,000 in 2021; his $1.25 million book deal with HarperCollins in 2022 made him a millionaire by the end of that year.[314][315][316]

Hillary Diane Rodham Clinton (née Rodham[a]; born October 26, 1947) is an American politician and diplomat. She was the 67th United States secretary of state in the administration of Barack Obama from 2009 to 2013, a U.S. senator representing New York from 2001 to 2009, and the first lady of the United States as the wife of Bill Clinton from 1993 to 2001. A member of the Democratic Party, she was the party's nominee in the 2016 presidential election, becoming the first woman to win a presidential nomination by a major U.S. political party and the only woman to win the popular vote for U.S. president. She is the only first lady of the United States to have run for elected office.

Rodham graduated from Wellesley College in 1969 and from Yale Law School in 1973. After serving as a congressional legal counsel, she moved to Arkansas and, in 1975, married Bill Clinton. In 1977, Clinton co-founded Arkansas Advocates for Children and Families, and in 1979 she became the first woman partner at Little Rock's Rose Law Firm. Clinton was the first lady of Arkansas from 1979 to 1981 and again from 1983 to 1992. As the first lady of the U.S., Clinton advocated for healthcare reform. In 1994, her health care plan failed to gain approval from Congress. In 1997 and 1999, Clinton played a leading role in promoting the creation of the State Children's Health Insurance Program, the Adoption and Safe Families Act, and the Foster Care Independence Act. In 1998, Clinton's marital relationship came under public scrutiny during the Lewinsky scandal, which led her to publicly reaffirm her commitment to the marriage.

Clinton was first elected to the U.S. Senate in 2000, becoming the first female senator from New York and the first First Lady to simultaneously hold elected office. As a senator, she chaired the Senate Democratic Steering and Outreach Committee from 2003 to 2007. Clinton ran for president in 2008, but lost to Barack Obama in the Democratic primaries. In 2009, she resigned from the Senate to become Obama's secretary of state. She responded to the Arab Spring by advocating the 2011 military intervention in Libya, but was harshly criticized by Republicans for the failure to prevent or adequately respond to the 2012 Benghazi attack. Clinton helped to organize a regime of international sanctions against Iran in an effort to force it to curtail its nuclear program, which eventually led to the multinational Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action in 2015. The strategic pivot to Asia was a central aspect of her tenure. Her use of a private email server as secretary was the subject of intense scrutiny; while no charges were filed, the controversy was the single-most-covered topic during her second presidential run in 2016. She won the Democratic nomination, but lost the general election to her Republican Party opponent, Donald Trump, in the Electoral College, while winning the popular vote.

Following her loss, she wrote multiple books and launched Onward Together, a political action organization dedicated to fundraising for progressive political groups. In 2011, Clinton was appointed the Honorary Founding Chair of the Institute for Women, Peace and Security at Georgetown University, and the awards named in her name has been awarded annually at the university. Since 2020, she has served as Chancellor of Queen's University Belfast. In 2023, Clinton joined Columbia University as a Professor of Practice at the School of International and Public Affairs.

Early life and education

Early life

Hillary Diane Rodham[1] was born on October 26, 1947, at Edgewater Hospital in Chicago, Illinois.[2][3] She was raised in a Methodist family who first lived in Chicago. When she was three years old, her family moved to the Chicago suburb of Park Ridge. Her father, Hugh Rodham, was of English and Welsh descent,[5] and founded a small but successful textile business. Her mother, Dorothy Howell, was a homemaker of Dutch, English, French Canadian (from Quebec), Scottish, and Welsh descent.[5][7][8] She grew up with two younger brothers, Hugh and Tony.

As a child, Rodham was a favorite student among her teachers at the public schools she attended in Park Ridge. She participated in swimming and softball and earned numerous badges as a Brownie and a Girl Scout. She was inspired by U.S. efforts during the Space Race and sent a letter to NASA around 1961 asking what she could do to become an astronaut, only to be informed that women were not being accepted into the program.[11] She attended Maine South High School,[12][13] where she participated in the student council and school newspaper and was selected for the National Honor Society.[2] She was elected class vice president for her junior year but then lost the election for class president for her senior year against two boys, one of whom told her that ""you are really stupid if you think a girl can be elected president"". For her senior year, she and other students were transferred to the then-new Maine South High School. There she was a National Merit Finalist and was voted ""most likely to succeed."" She graduated in 1965 in the top five percent of her class.

Rodham's mother wanted her to have an independent, professional career.[8] Her father, who was otherwise a traditionalist, felt that his daughter's abilities and opportunities should not be limited by gender. She was raised in a politically conservative household,[8] and she helped canvass Chicago's South Side at age 13 after the very close 1960 U.S. presidential election. She stated that, while investigating with a fellow teenage friend shortly after the election, she saw evidence of electoral fraud (a voting list entry showing a dozen addresses that was an empty lot) against Republican candidate Richard Nixon; she later volunteered to campaign for Republican candidate Barry Goldwater in the 1964 election.[19]

Rodham's early political development was shaped mostly by two people. Her high school history teacher, Paul Carlson, was one. Like her father, Carlson was a fervent anti-communist, who introduced her to Goldwater's The Conscience of a Conservative. Another was Donald Jones, her Methodist youth minister, who, like her mother, was concerned with issues of social justice). She was with Jones' youth group when she saw and afterwards briefly met civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. when he gave a speech in 1962 at Chicago's Orchestra Hall.[b] Carlson and Jones came into conflict in Park Ridge; Clinton would later see that as ""an early indication of the cultural, political and religious fault lines that developed across America in the [next] forty years"".

Wellesley College years

Rodham campaigning for Wellesley College government president in 1968, an election which she later won

In 1965, Rodham enrolled at Wellesley College, where she majored in political science.[23][24] During her first year, she was president of the Wellesley Young Republicans.[25][26] As the leader of this ""Rockefeller Republican""-oriented group,[27] she supported the elections of moderate Republicans John Lindsay to mayor of New York City and Massachusetts attorney general Edward Brooke to the United States Senate. She later stepped down from this position. In 2003, Clinton would write that her views concerning the civil rights movement and the Vietnam War were changing in her early college years.[25] In a letter to her youth minister at that time, she described herself as ""a mind conservative and a heart liberal"".[29] In contrast to the factions in the 1960s that advocated radical actions against the political system, she sought to work for change within it.[30][31]

By her junior year, Rodham became a supporter of the antiwar presidential nomination campaign of Democrat Eugene McCarthy.[32] In early 1968, she was elected president of the Wellesley College Government Association, a position she held until early 1969.[30][33] Following the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr., Rodham organized a two-day student strike and worked with Wellesley's black students to recruit more black students and faculty.[32] In her student government role, she played a role in keeping Wellesley from being embroiled in the student disruptions common to other colleges.[30] A number of her fellow students thought she might some day become the first female president of the United States.[30]

To help her better understand her changing political views, Professor Alan Schechter assigned Rodham to intern at the House Republican Conference, and she attended the ""Wellesley in Washington"" summer program.[32] Rodham was invited by moderate New York Republican representative Charles Goodell to help Governor Nelson Rockefeller's late-entry campaign for the Republican nomination.[32] Rodham attended the 1968 Republican National Convention in Miami Beach. However, she was upset by the way Richard Nixon's campaign portrayed Rockefeller and by what she perceived as the convention's ""veiled"" racist messages, and she left the Republican Party for good.[32] Rodham wrote her senior thesis, a critique of the tactics of radical community organizer Saul Alinsky, under Professor Schechter.[35] Years later, while she was the first lady, access to her thesis was restricted at the request of the White House and it became the subject of some speculation. The thesis was later released.[35]

In 1969, she graduated with a Bachelor of Arts,[36] with departmental honors in political science.[35] After some fellow seniors requested that the college administration allow a student speaker at commencement, she became the first student in Wellesley College history to speak at the event. Her address followed that of the commencement speaker, Senator Edward Brooke.[33] After her speech, she received a standing ovation that lasted seven minutes.[30][38][39] She was featured in an article published in Life magazine,[40][41] because of the response to a part of her speech that criticized Senator Brooke. She also appeared on Irv Kupcinet's nationally syndicated television talk show as well as in Illinois and New England newspapers. She was asked to speak at the 50th anniversary convention of the League of Women Voters in Washington, D.C., the next year.[43] That summer, she worked her way across Alaska, washing dishes in Mount McKinley National Park and sliming salmon in a fish processing cannery in Valdez (which fired her and shut down overnight when she complained about unhealthy conditions).[44]

Yale Law School and postgraduate studies

Rodham then entered Yale Law School, where she was on the editorial board of the Yale Review of Law and Social Action.[45] During her second year, she worked at the Yale Child Study Center, learning about new research on early childhood brain development and working as a research assistant on the seminal work, Beyond the Best Interests of the Child (1973).[48] She also took on cases of child abuse at Yale–New Haven Hospital, and volunteered at New Haven Legal Services to provide free legal advice for the poor. In the summer of 1970, she was awarded a grant to work at Marian Wright Edelman's Washington Research Project, where she was assigned to Senator Walter Mondale's Subcommittee on Migratory Labor. There she researched various migrant workers' issues including education, health and housing.[49] Edelman later became a significant mentor. Rodham was recruited by political advisor Anne Wexler to work on the 1970 campaign of Connecticut U.S. Senate candidate Joseph Duffey. Rodham later crediting Wexler with providing her first job in politics.[51]

In the spring of 1971, she began dating fellow law student Bill Clinton. During the summer, she interned at the Oakland, California, law firm of Treuhaft, Walker and Burnstein. The firm was well known for its support of constitutional rights, civil liberties and radical causes (two of its four partners were current or former Communist Party members); Rodham worked on child custody and other cases.[c] Clinton canceled his original summer plans and moved to live with her in California;[56] the couple continued living together in New Haven when they returned to law school.[53] The following summer, Rodham and Clinton campaigned in Texas for unsuccessful 1972 Democratic presidential candidate George McGovern. She received a Juris Doctor degree from Yale in 1973,[36] having stayed on an extra year to be with Clinton. He first proposed marriage to her following graduation, but she declined, uncertain if she wanted to tie her future to his.

Rodham began a year of postgraduate study on children and medicine at the Yale Child Study Center.[59] In late 1973, her first scholarly article, ""Children Under the Law"", was published in the Harvard Educational Review.[60] Discussing the new children's rights movement, the article stated that ""child citizens"" were ""powerless individuals""[61] and argued that children should not be considered equally incompetent from birth to attaining legal age, but instead that courts should presume competence on a case-by-case basis, except when there is evidence otherwise.[62] The article became frequently cited in the field.[63]

Marriage, family, legal career and first ladyship of Arkansas

From the East Coast to Arkansas

During her postgraduate studies, Rodham was staff attorney for Edelman's newly founded Children's Defense Fund in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and as a consultant to the Carnegie Council on Children. In 1974, she was a member of the impeachment inquiry staff in Washington, D.C., and advised the House Committee on the Judiciary during the Watergate scandal. The committee's work culminated with the resignation of President Richard Nixon in August 1974.

By then, Rodham was viewed as someone with a bright political future. Democratic political organizer and consultant Betsey Wright moved from Texas to Washington the previous year to help guide Rodham's career. Wright thought Rodham had the potential to become a future senator or president. Meanwhile, boyfriend Bill Clinton had repeatedly asked Rodham to marry him, but she continued to demur. After failing the District of Columbia bar exam[70] and passing the Arkansas exam, Rodham came to a key decision. As she later wrote, ""I chose to follow my heart instead of my head"". She thus followed Clinton to Arkansas, rather than staying in Washington, where career prospects were brighter. He was then teaching law and running for a seat in the U.S. House of Representatives in his home state. In August 1974, Rodham moved to Fayetteville, Arkansas, and became one of only two female faculty members at the University of Arkansas School of Law in Fayetteville, Arkansas.

Early Arkansas years

Rodham became the first director of a new legal aid clinic at the University of Arkansas School of Law. During her time in Fayetteville, Rodham and several other women founded the city's first rape crisis center.

In 1974, Bill Clinton lost an Arkansas congressional race, facing incumbent Republican John Paul Hammerschmidt. Rodham and Bill Clinton bought a house in Fayetteville in the summer of 1975 and she agreed to marry him. The wedding took place on October 11, 1975, in a Methodist ceremony in their living room. A story about the marriage in the Arkansas Gazette indicated that she decided to retain the name Hillary Rodham.[79] Her motivation was threefold. She wanted to keep the couple's professional lives separate, avoid apparent conflicts of interest, and as she told a friend at the time, ""it showed that I was still me"". The decision upset both mothers, who were more traditional.

In 1976, Rodham temporarily relocated to Indianapolis to work as an Indiana state campaign organizer for the presidential campaign of Jimmy Carter.[82][83] In November 1976, Bill Clinton was elected Arkansas attorney general, and the couple moved to the state capital of Little Rock. In February 1977, Rodham joined the venerable Rose Law Firm, a bastion of Arkansan political and economic influence.[84] She specialized in patent infringement and intellectual property law[45] while working pro bono in child advocacy. In 1977, Rodham cofounded Arkansas Advocates for Children and Families, a state-level alliance with the Children's Defense Fund.[45]

Later in 1977, President Jimmy Carter (for whom Rodham had been the 1976 campaign director of field operations in Indiana) appointed her to the board of directors of the Legal Services Corporation.[88] She held that position from 1978 until the end of 1981.[89] From mid-1978 to mid-1980,[d] she served as the first female chair of that board.[90]

Following her husband's November 1978 election as governor of Arkansas, Rodham became that state's first lady in January 1979. She would hold that title for twelve nonconsecutive years (1979–1981, 1983–1992). Clinton appointed his wife to be the chair of the Rural Health Advisory Committee the same year,[91] in which role she secured federal funds to expand medical facilities in Arkansas's poorest areas without affecting doctors' fees.

In 1979, Rodham became the first woman to be made a full partner in Rose Law Firm. From 1978 until they entered the White House, she had a higher salary than her husband. During 1978 and 1979, while looking to supplement their income, Rodham engaged in the trading of cattle futures contracts; an initial $1,000 investment generated nearly $100,000 when she stopped trading after ten months. At this time, the couple began their ill-fated investment in the Whitewater Development Corporation real estate venture with Jim and Susan McDougal. Both of these became subjects of controversy in the 1990s.

On February 27, 1980, Rodham gave birth to the couple's only child, a daughter whom they named Chelsea. In November 1980, Bill Clinton was defeated in his bid for re-election.

Later Arkansas years

The Clintons with Ronald and Nancy Reagan in 1987

Two years after leaving office, Bill Clinton returned to the governorship of Arkansas after winning the election of 1982. During her husband's campaign, Hillary began to use the name ""Hillary Clinton"", or sometimes ""Mrs. Bill Clinton"", to assuage the concerns of Arkansas voters; she also took a leave of absence from Rose Law to campaign for him full-time. During her second stint as the first lady of Arkansas, she made a point of using Hillary Rodham Clinton as her name.[e]

Clinton became involved in state education policy. She was named chair of the Arkansas Education Standards Committee in 1983, where worked to reform the state's public education system.[105][106] In one of the Clinton governorship's most important initiatives, she fought a prolonged but ultimately successful battle against the Arkansas Education Association to establish mandatory teacher testing and state standards for curriculum and classroom size.[91][105] In 1985, she introduced Arkansas's Home Instruction Program for Preschool Youth, a program that helps parents work with their children in preschool preparedness and literacy.[107]

Clinton continued to practice law with the Rose Law Firm while she was the first lady of Arkansas.[109] The firm considered her a ""rainmaker"" because she brought in clients, partly thanks to the prestige she lent it and to her corporate board connections. She was also very influential in the appointment of state judges.[109] Bill Clinton's Republican opponent in his 1986 gubernatorial reelection campaign accused the Clintons of conflict of interest because Rose Law did state business; the Clintons countered the charge by saying that state fees were walled off by the firm before her profits were calculated. Clinton was twice named by The National Law Journal as one of the 100 most influential lawyers in America—in 1988 and 1991. When Bill Clinton thought about not running again for governor in 1990, Hillary Clinton considered running. Private polls were unfavorable, however, and in the end he ran and was reelected for the final time.

From 1982 to 1988, Clinton was on the board of directors, sometimes as chair, of the New World Foundation,[113] which funded a variety of New Left interest groups.[114] Clinton was chairman of the board of the Children's Defense Fund[2][115] and on the board of the Arkansas Children's Hospital's Legal Services (1988–1992).[116] In addition to her positions with nonprofit organizations, she also held positions on the corporate board of directors of TCBY (1985–1992),[117] Wal-Mart Stores (1986–1992)[118] and Lafarge (1990–1992).[119] TCBY and Wal-Mart were Arkansas-based companies that were also clients of Rose Law.[109][120] Clinton was the first female member on Wal-Mart's board, added following pressure on chairman Sam Walton to name a woman to it.[120] Once there, she pushed successfully for Wal-Mart to adopt more environmentally friendly practices. She was largely unsuccessful in her campaign for more women to be added to the company's management and was silent about the company's famously anti-labor union practices.[118][120][121] According to Dan Kaufman, awareness of this later became a factor in her loss of credibility with organized labor, helping contribute to her loss in the 2016 election, where slightly less than half of union members voted for Donald Trump.[122][123]

Bill Clinton 1992 presidential campaign

Clinton in 1992

Clinton received sustained national attention for the first time when her husband became a candidate for the 1992 Democratic presidential nomination. Before the New Hampshire primary, tabloid publications printed allegations that Bill Clinton had engaged in an extramarital affair with Gennifer Flowers.[124] In response, the Clintons appeared together on 60 Minutes, where Bill denied the affair, but acknowledged ""causing pain in my marriage"".[125] This joint appearance was credited with rescuing his campaign.[126] During the campaign, Hillary made culturally disparaging remarks about Tammy Wynette's outlook on marriage as described in her classic song ""Stand by Your Man"".[f] Later in the campaign, she commented she could have chosen to be like women staying home and baking cookies and having teas, but wanted to pursue her career instead.[g] The remarks were widely criticized, particularly by those who were, or defended, stay-at-home mothers. In retrospect, she admitted they were ill-considered. Bill said that in electing him, the nation would ""get two for the price of one"", referring to the prominent role his wife would assume. Beginning with Daniel Wattenberg's August 1992 The American Spectator article ""The Lady Macbeth of Little Rock"", Hillary's own past ideological and ethical record came under attack from conservatives.[133] At least twenty other articles in major publications also drew comparisons between her and Lady Macbeth.[134]

First Lady of the United States (1993–2001)

Hillary Clinton's official portrait as First Lady, 1994

When Bill Clinton took office as president in January 1993, Hillary Rodham Clinton became the first lady. Her press secretary reiterated she would be using that form of her name.[e] She was the first in this role to have a postgraduate degree and her own professional career up to the time of entering the White House.[135] She was also the first to have an office in the West Wing of the White House in addition to the usual first lady offices in the East Wing.[59][136] During the presidential transition, she was part of the innermost circle vetting appointments to the new administration. Her choices filled at least eleven top-level positions and dozens more lower-level ones.[137][138] After Eleanor Roosevelt, Clinton was regarded as the most openly empowered presidential wife in American history.[139][140]

Some critics called it inappropriate for the first lady to play a central role in public policy matters. Supporters pointed out that Clinton's role in policy was no different from that of other White House advisors, and that voters had been well aware she would play an active role in her husband's presidency.[141]

Health care and other policy initiatives

Clinton presenting her health care plan to Congress in 1993

In January 1993, President Clinton named Hillary to chair a task force on National Health Care Reform, hoping to replicate the success she had in leading the effort for Arkansas education reform. The recommendation of the task force became known as the Clinton health care plan. This was a comprehensive proposal that would require employers to provide health coverage to their employees through individual health maintenance organizations. Its opponents quickly derided the plan as ""Hillarycare"" and it even faced opposition from some Democrats in Congress.

Failing to gather enough support for a floor vote in either the House or the Senate (although Democrats controlled both chambers), the proposal was abandoned in September 1994. Clinton later acknowledged in her memoir that her political inexperience partly contributed to the defeat but cited many other factors. The first lady's approval ratings, which had generally been in the high-50 percent range during her first year, fell to 44 percent in April 1994 and 35 percent by September 1994.[145]

The Republican Party negatively highlighted the Clinton health care plan in their campaign for the 1994 midterm elections.[146] The Republican Party saw strong success in the midterms, and many analysts and pollsters found the healthcare plan to be a major factor in the Democrats' defeat, especially among independent voters.[147] After this, the White House subsequently sought to downplay Clinton's role in shaping policy.

Along with senators Ted Kennedy and Orrin Hatch, Clinton was a force behind the passage of the State Children's Health Insurance Program in 1997, which gave state support to children whose parents could not provide them health coverage. She participated in campaigns to promote the enrollment of children in the program after it took effect.[149]

Enactment of welfare reform was a major goal of Bill Clinton's presidency. When the first two bills on the issue came from a Republican-controlled Congress lacking protections for people coming off welfare, Hillary urged her husband to veto the bills, which he did.[151] A third version came up during his 1996 general election campaign that restored some of the protections but cut the scope of benefits in other areas. While Clinton was urged to persuade the president to similarly veto the bill, she decided to support the bill, which became the Welfare Reform Act of 1996, as the best political compromise available.[151]

Together with Attorney General Janet Reno, Clinton helped create the Office on Violence Against Women at the Department of Justice.[59] In 1997, she initiated and shepherded the Adoption and Safe Families Act, which she regarded as her greatest accomplishment as the first lady.[59][152] In 1999, she was instrumental in the passage of the Foster Care Independence Act, which doubled federal monies for teenagers aging out of foster care.[152]

International diplomacy and promotion of women's rights

Clinton traveled to 79 countries as first lady,[153] breaking the record for most-traveled first lady previously held by Pat Nixon.[154] She did not hold a security clearance or attend National Security Council meetings, but played a role in U.S. diplomacy attaining its objectives.[155]

In a September 1995 speech before the Fourth World Conference on Women in Beijing, Clinton argued forcefully against practices that abused women around the world and in the People's Republic of China itself. She declared, ""it is no longer acceptable to discuss women's rights as separate from human rights"".[156] Delegates from over 180 countries heard her declare,

If there is one message that echoes forth from this conference, let it be that human rights are women's rights and women's rights are human rights, once and for all.""[157]

In delivering these remarks, Clinton resisted both internal administration and Chinese pressure to soften her remarks.[153][157] The speech became a key moment in the empowerment of women and years later women around the world would recite Clinton's key phrases.

During the late 1990s, Clinton was one of the most prominent international figures to speak out against the treatment of Afghan women by the Taliban.[159][160] She helped create Vital Voices, an international initiative sponsored by the U.S. to encourage the participation of women in the political processes of their countries.

Scandals and investigations

One prominent investigation regarding Clinton was the Whitewater controversy, which arose out of real estate investments by the Clintons and associates made in the 1970s.[162][162] As part of this investigation, on January 26, 1996, Clinton became the first spouse of a U.S. president to be subpoenaed to testify before a federal grand jury.[163] After several Independent Counsels had investigated, a final report was issued in 2000 that stated there was insufficient evidence that either Clinton had engaged in criminal wrongdoing.[164]

Another investigated scandal involving Clinton was the White House travel office controversy, often referred to as ""Travelgate"". Another scandal that arose was the Hillary Clinton cattle futures controversy, which related to cattle futures trading Clinton had made in 1978 and 1979.[166] Some in the press had alleged that Clinton had engaged in a conflict of interest and disguised a bribery. Several individuals analyzed her trading records; however, no formal investigation was made and she was never charged with any wrongdoing in relation to this.[167]

An outgrowth of the ""Travelgate"" investigation was the June 1996 discovery of improper White House access to hundreds of FBI background reports on former Republican White House employees, an affair that some called ""Filegate"".[168] Accusations were made that Clinton had requested these files and she had recommended hiring an unqualified individual to head the White House Security Office.[169] The 2000 final Independent Counsel report found no substantial or credible evidence that Clinton had any role or showed any misconduct in the matter.[168]

In early 2001, a controversy arose over gifts that were sent to the White House; there was a question whether the furnishings were White House property or the Clintons' personal property. During the last year of Bill Clinton's time in office, those gifts were shipped to the Clintons' private residence.[170][171]

It Takes a Village and other writings

In 1996, Clinton presented a vision for American children in the book It Takes a Village: And Other Lessons Children Teach Us. In January 1996, she went on a ten-city book tour and made numerous television appearances to promote the book,[172] although she was frequently hit with questions about her involvement in the Whitewater and Travelgate controversies.[173][174] The book spent 18 weeks on the New York Times Best Seller List that year, including three weeks at number one.[175] By 2000, it had sold 450,000 copies in hardcover and another 200,000 in paperback.[176] Clinton received the Grammy Award for Best Spoken Word Album in 1997 for the book's audio recording.

Other books published by Clinton when she was the first lady include Dear Socks, Dear Buddy: Kids' Letters to the First Pets (1998) and An Invitation to the White House: At Home with History (2000). In 2001, she wrote an afterword to the children's book Beatrice's Goat.[178]

Clinton also published a weekly syndicated newspaper column titled ""Talking It Over"" from 1995 to 2000.[179][180] It focused on her experiences and those of women, children and families she met during her travels around the world.[2]

Response to Lewinsky scandal

In 1998, the Clintons' private concerns became the subject of much speculation when investigations revealed the president had engaged in an extramarital affair with 22-year-old White House intern Monica Lewinsky.[181] Events surrounding the Lewinsky scandal eventually led to the impeachment of the president by the House of Representatives; he was later acquitted by the Senate. When the allegations against her husband were first made public, Hillary Clinton stated that the allegations were part of a ""vast right-wing conspiracy"".[182][183] Clinton characterized the Lewinsky charges as the latest in a long, organized, collaborative series of charges by Bill's political enemies[h] rather than any wrongdoing by her husband. She later said she had been misled by his initial claims that no affair had taken place.[185] After the evidence of President Clinton's encounters with Lewinsky became incontrovertible, she issued a public statement reaffirming her commitment to their marriage. Privately, she was reported to be furious at him and was unsure if she wanted to remain in the marriage. The White House residence staff noticed a pronounced level of tension between the couple during this period.

Public response to Clinton's handling of the matter varied. Women variously admired her strength and poise in private matters that were made public. They sympathized with her as a victim of her husband's insensitive behavior and criticized her as being an enabler to her husband's indiscretions. They also accused her of cynically staying in a failed marriage as a way of keeping or even fostering her own political influence. In the wake of the revelations, her public approval ratings shot upward to around 70 percent, the highest they had ever been.

Save America's Treasures initiative

Clinton was the founding chair of Save America's Treasures, a nationwide effort matching federal funds with private donations to preserve and restore historic items and sites.[189] This included the flag that inspired ""The Star-Spangled Banner"" and the First Ladies National Historic Site in Canton, Ohio.[59]

Traditional duties

Clinton was the head of the White House Millennium Council[190] and hosted Millennium Evenings,[191] a series of lectures that discussed futures studies, one of which became the first live simultaneous webcast from the White House.[59] Clinton also created the first White House Sculpture Garden, located in the Jacqueline Kennedy Garden.[192]

Working with Arkansas interior decorator Kaki Hockersmith over an eight-year period, Clinton oversaw extensive, privately funded redecoration efforts of the White House. Overall the redecoration received a mixed reaction.

Clinton hosted many large-scale events at the White House. Examples include a state dinner for visiting Chinese dignitaries, a New Year's Eve celebration at the turn of the 21st century, and a state dinner honoring the bicentennial of the White House in November 2000.[59]

U.S. Senate (2001–2009)

2000 U.S. Senate election

Hillary Clinton's official senate portrait

When New York's long-serving U.S. senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan announced his retirement in November 1998, several prominent Democratic figures, including Representative Charles Rangel of New York, urged Clinton to run for his open seat in the Senate election of 2000. Once she decided to run, the Clintons purchased a home in Chappaqua, New York, north of New York City, in September 1999.[195] She became the first wife of the president of the United States to be a candidate for elected office. Initially, Clinton expected to face Rudy Giuliani—the mayor of New York City—as her Republican opponent in the election. Giuliani withdrew from the race in May 2000 after being diagnosed with prostate cancer and matters related to his failing marriage became public. Clinton then faced Rick Lazio, a Republican member of the U.S. House of Representatives who represented New York's 2nd congressional district. Throughout the campaign, opponents accused Clinton of carpetbagging, because she had never resided in New York State or participated in the state's politics before the 2000 Senate race.

Bill de Blasio was Clinton's campaign manager. She began her drive to the U.S. Senate by visiting all 62 counties in the state, in a ""listening tour"" of small-group settings. She devoted considerable time in traditionally Republican Upstate New York regions. Clinton vowed to improve the economic situation in those areas, promising to deliver 200,000 jobs to the state over her term. Her plan included tax credits to reward job creation and encourage business investment, especially in the high-tech sector. She called for personal tax cuts for college tuition and long-term care.[199]

The contest drew national attention. During a September debate, Lazio blundered when he seemed to invade Clinton's personal space by trying to get her to sign a fundraising agreement. Their campaigns, along with Giuliani's initial effort, spent a record combined $90 million.[201] Clinton won the election on November 7, 2000, with 55 percent of the vote to Lazio's 43 percent. She was sworn in as U.S. senator on January 3, 2001, and as George W. Bush was still 17 days away from being inaugurated as president after winning the 2000 presidential election, that meant from January 3–20, she simultaneously held the titles of First Lady and Senator – a first in U.S. history.

First term

Because Bill Clinton's term as president did not end until 17 days after she was sworn in, upon entering the Senate, Clinton became the first and so far only first lady to serve as a senator and first lady concurrently. Clinton maintained a low public profile and built relationships with senators from both parties when she started her term.[203] She forged alliances with religiously inclined senators by becoming a regular participant in the Senate Prayer Breakfast.[204] She sat on five Senate committees: Committee on Budget (2001–02),[206] Committee on Armed Services (2003–09),[207] Committee on Environment and Public Works (2001–09), Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions (2001–09)[206] and Special Committee on Aging.[208] She was also a member of the Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe[209] (2001–09).[210]

Following the September 11 terrorist attacks, Clinton sought to obtain funding for the recovery efforts in New York City and security improvements in her state. Working with New York's senior senator, Chuck Schumer, she was instrumental in securing $21 billion in funding for the World Trade Center site's redevelopment. She subsequently took a leading role in investigating the health issues faced by 9/11 first responders. Clinton voted for the USA Patriot Act in October 2001. In 2005, when the act was up for renewal, she expressed concerns with the USA Patriot Act Reauthorization Conference Report regarding civil liberties.[213] In March 2006, she voted in favor of the USA PATRIOT Improvement and Reauthorization Act of 2005 that had gained large majority support.[214]

Clinton strongly supported the 2001 U.S. military action in Afghanistan, saying it was a chance to combat terrorism while improving the lives of Afghan women who suffered under the Taliban government.[215] Clinton voted in favor of the October 2002 Iraq War Resolution, which authorized President George W. Bush to use military force against Iraq.[216]

After the Iraq War began, Clinton made trips to Iraq and Afghanistan to visit American troops stationed there. On a visit to Iraq in February 2005, Clinton noted that the insurgency had failed to disrupt the democratic elections held earlier and that parts of the country were functioning well.[217] Observing that war deployments were draining regular and reserve forces, she co-introduced legislation to increase the size of the regular U.S. Army by 80,000 soldiers to ease the strain.[218] In late 2005, Clinton said that while immediate withdrawal from Iraq would be a mistake, Bush's pledge to stay ""until the job is done"" was also misguided, as it gave Iraqis ""an open-ended invitation not to take care of themselves"".[219] Her stance caused frustration among those in the Democratic Party who favored quick withdrawal. Clinton supported retaining and improving health benefits for reservists and lobbied against the closure of several military bases, especially those in New York.[221][222] She used her position on the Armed Services Committee to forge close relationships with a number of high-ranking military officers.[222] By 2014 and 2015 Clinton had fully reversed herself on the Iraq War Resolution, saying she ""got it wrong"" and the vote in support had been a ""mistake"".[223]

Clinton voted against President Bush's two major tax cut packages, the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 and the Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003.[224] In 2003, Simon & Schuster released her memoir Living History. The book set a first-week sales record for a nonfiction work,[226] went on to sell more than one million copies in the first month following publication,[227] and was translated into twelve foreign languages.[228] Clinton's audio recording of the book earned her a nomination for the Grammy Award for Best Spoken Word Album.[229]

Clinton voted against the 2005 confirmation of John Roberts as chief justice of the United States and the 2006 confirmation of Samuel Alito to the U.S. Supreme Court, filibustering the latter.[230][231]

In 2005, Clinton called for the Federal Trade Commission to investigate how hidden sex scenes showed up in the controversial video game Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas.[232] Along with senators Joe Lieberman and Evan Bayh, she introduced the Family Entertainment Protection Act, intended to protect children from inappropriate content found in video games. In 2004 and 2006, Clinton voted against the Federal Marriage Amendment that sought to prohibit same-sex marriage.[224][233]

Looking to establish a ""progressive infrastructure"" to rival that of American conservatism, Clinton played a formative role in conversations that led to the 2003 founding of former Clinton administration chief of staff John Podesta's Center for American Progress, shared aides with Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, founded in 2003 and advised the Clintons' former antagonist David Brock's Media Matters for America, created in 2004. Following the 2004 Senate elections, she successfully pushed new Democratic Senate leader Harry Reid to create a Senate war room to handle daily political messaging.

2006 reelection campaign

In November 2004, Clinton announced she would seek a second Senate term. She easily won the Democratic nomination over opposition from antiwar activist Jonathan Tasini.[236][237] The early frontrunner for the Republican nomination, Westchester County District Attorney Jeanine Pirro, withdrew from the contest after several months of poor campaign performance.[238] Clinton's eventual opponent in the general election was Republican candidate John Spencer, a former mayor of Yonkers. Clinton won the election on November 7, 2006, with 67 percent of the vote to Spencer's 31 percent,[239] carrying all but four of New York's sixty-two counties.[240] Her campaign spent $36 million for her reelection, more than any other candidate for Senate in the 2006 elections. Some Democrats criticized her for spending too much in a one-sided contest, while some supporters were concerned she did not leave more funds for a potential presidential bid in 2008.[241] In the following months, she transferred $10 million of her Senate funds toward her presidential campaign.

Second term

Clinton opposed the Iraq War troop surge of 2007, for both military and domestic political reasons (by the following year, she was privately acknowledging the surge had been successful).[i] In March of that year, she voted in favor of a war-spending bill that required President Bush to begin withdrawing troops from Iraq by a deadline; it passed almost completely along party lines[244] but was subsequently vetoed by Bush. In May, a compromise war funding bill that removed withdrawal deadlines but tied funding to progress benchmarks for the Iraqi government passed the Senate by a vote of 80–14 and would be signed by Bush; Clinton was one of those who voted against it.[245] She responded to General David Petraeus's September 2007 Report to Congress on the Situation in Iraq by saying, ""I think that the reports that you provide to us really require a willing suspension of disbelief.""[246]

In March 2007, in response to the dismissal of U.S. attorneys controversy, Clinton called on Attorney General Alberto Gonzales to resign.[247] Regarding the high-profile, hotly debated immigration reform bill known as the Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act of 2007, Clinton cast several votes in support of the bill, which eventually failed to gain cloture.[248]

As the financial crisis of 2007–08 reached a peak with the liquidity crisis of September 2008, Clinton supported the proposed bailout of the U.S. financial system, voting in favor of the $700 billion law that created the Troubled Asset Relief Program, saying it represented the interests of the American people. It passed the Senate 74–25.[249]

In 2007, Clinton and Virginia senator Jim Webb called for an investigation into whether the body armor issued to soldiers in Iraq was adequate.[250]

2008 presidential campaign

Clinton had been preparing for a potential candidacy for U.S. president since at least early 2003. On January 20, 2007, she announced via her website the formation of a presidential exploratory committee for the United States presidential election of 2008, stating: ""I'm in and I'm in to win."" No woman had ever been nominated by a major party for the presidency, and no first lady had ever run for president. When Bill Clinton became president in 1993, a blind trust was established; in April 2007, the Clintons liquidated the blind trust to avoid the possibility of ethical conflicts or political embarrassments as Hillary undertook her presidential race. Later disclosure statements revealed the couple's worth was now upwards of $50 million.[253] They had earned over $100 million since 2000—most of it coming from Bill's books, speaking engagements and other activities.[254]

Clinton at the 2007 CDA National Convention

Throughout the first half of 2007, Clinton led candidates competing for the Democratic presidential nomination in opinion polls for the election. Senator Barack Obama of Illinois and former senator John Edwards of North Carolina were her strongest competitors.[216] The biggest threat to her campaign was her past support of the Iraq War, which Obama had opposed from the beginning.[216] Clinton and Obama both set records for early fundraising, swapping the money lead each quarter.[255] At the end of October, Clinton fared poorly in her debate performance against Obama, Edwards, and her other opponents. Obama's message of change began to resonate with the Democratic electorate better than Clinton's message of experience.[258]

In the first vote of 2008, she placed third in the January 3 Iowa Democratic caucus behind Obama and Edwards. Obama gained ground in national polling in the next few days, with all polls predicting a victory for him in the New Hampshire primary.[260] Clinton gained a surprise win there on January 8, narrowly defeating Obama. It was the first time a woman had won a major American party's presidential primary for the purposes of delegate selection.[262] Explanations for Clinton's New Hampshire comeback varied but often centered on her being seen more sympathetically, especially by women, after her eyes welled with tears and her voice broke while responding to a voter's question the day before the election.[263]

The nature of the contest fractured in the next few days. Several remarks by Bill Clinton and other surrogates,[264] and a remark by Hillary Clinton concerning Martin Luther King Jr. and Lyndon B. Johnson,[j] were perceived by many as, accidentally or intentionally, limiting Obama as a racially oriented candidate or otherwise denying the post-racial significance and accomplishments of his campaign.[265] Despite attempts by both Hillary and Obama to downplay the issue, Democratic voting became more polarized as a result, with Clinton losing much of her support among African Americans.[264][266] She lost by a two-to-one margin to Obama in the January 26, South Carolina primary,[266] setting up, with Edwards soon dropping out, an intense two-person contest for the twenty-two February 5 Super Tuesday states. The South Carolina campaign had done lasting damage to Clinton, eroding her support among the Democratic establishment and leading to the prized endorsement of Obama by Ted Kennedy.

On Super Tuesday, Clinton won the largest states, such as California, New York, New Jersey and Massachusetts, while Obama won more states; they almost evenly split the total popular vote. But Obama was gaining more pledged delegates for his share of the popular vote due to better exploitation of the Democratic proportional allocation rules.[270]

The Clinton campaign had counted on winning the nomination by Super Tuesday and was unprepared financially and logistically for a prolonged effort; lagging in Internet fundraising as Clinton began loaning money to her campaign.[258][271] There was continuous turmoil within the campaign staff, and she made several top-level personnel changes.[271] Obama won the next eleven February contests across the country, often by large margins and took a significant pledged delegate lead over Clinton.[270][271] On March 4, Clinton broke the string of losses by winning in Ohio among other places,[271] where her criticism of NAFTA, a major legacy of her husband's presidency, helped in a state where the trade agreement was unpopular. Throughout the campaign, Obama dominated caucuses, for which the Clinton campaign largely ignored and failed to prepare.[258][270] Obama did well in primaries where African Americans or younger, college-educated, or more affluent voters were heavily represented; Clinton did well in primaries where Hispanics or older, non-college-educated, or working-class white voters predominated.[274][275] Behind in delegates, Clinton's best hope of winning the nomination came in persuading uncommitted, party-appointed superdelegates.[276]

Clinton speaks on behalf of her former rival, Barack Obama, during the second night of the 2008 Democratic National Convention.

Following the final primaries on June 3, 2008, Obama had gained enough delegates to become the presumptive nominee. In a speech before her supporters on June 7, Clinton ended her campaign and endorsed Obama. By campaign's end, Clinton had won 1,640 pledged delegates to Obama's 1,763;[279] at the time of the clinching, Clinton had 286 superdelegates to Obama's 395,[280] with those numbers widening to 256 versus 438 once Obama was acknowledged the winner.[279] Clinton and Obama each received over 17 million votes during the nomination process[k] with both breaking the previous record.[281] Clinton was the first woman to run in the primary or caucus of every state and she eclipsed, by a very wide margin, Congresswoman Shirley Chisholm's 1972 marks for most votes garnered and delegates won by a woman.[262] Clinton gave a passionate speech supporting Obama at the 2008 Democratic National Convention and campaigned frequently for him in fall 2008, which concluded with his victory over McCain in the general election on November 4.[282]

Secretary of State (2009–2013)

Hillary Clinton was sworn in as Secretary of State by Associate Judge Kathryn Oberly on January 21, 2009.

Hillary Clinton's official portrait as Secretary of State, 2009

Nomination and confirmation

In mid-November 2008, President-elect Obama and Clinton discussed the possibility of her serving as secretary of state in his administration. She was initially quite reluctant, but on November 20 she told Obama she would accept the position.[284] On December 1, President-elect Obama formally announced that Clinton would be his nominee for secretary of state.[286][287] Clinton said she did not want to leave the Senate, but that the new position represented a ""difficult and exciting adventure"".[287] As part of the nomination and to relieve concerns of conflict of interest, Bill Clinton agreed to accept several conditions and restrictions regarding his ongoing activities and fundraising efforts for the William J. Clinton Foundation and the Clinton Global Initiative.

The appointment required a Saxbe fix, passed and signed into law in December 2008.[289] Confirmation hearings before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee began on January 13, 2009, a week before the Obama inauguration; two days later, the committee voted 16–1 to approve Clinton.[290] By this time, her public approval rating had reached 65 percent, the highest point since the Lewinsky scandal.[291] On January 21, 2009, Clinton was confirmed in the full Senate by a vote of 94–2.[292] Clinton took the oath of office of secretary of state, resigning from the Senate later that day.[293] She became the first former first lady to be a member of the United States Cabinet.[294]

Tenure

During her tenure as secretary of state, Clinton and President Obama forged a positive working relationship that lacked power struggles. Clinton was regarded to be a team player within the Obama administration. She was also considered a defender of the administration to the public. She was regarded to be cautious to prevent herself or her husband from upstaging the president.[295][296] Obama and Clinton both approached foreign policy as a largely non-ideological, pragmatic exercise.[284] Clinton met with Obama weekly, but did not have the close, daily relationship that some of her predecessors had had with their presidents.[296] Nevertheless, Obama was trusting of Clinton's actions.[284] Clinton also formed an alliance with Secretary of Defense Robert Gates with whom she shared similar strategic outlooks.[297]

As secretary of state, Clinton sought to lead a rehabilitation of the United States' reputation on the world stage. After taking office, Clinton spent several days telephoning dozens of world leaders and indicating that U.S. foreign policy would change direction. Days into her tenure, she remarked, ""We have a lot of damage to repair.""[298]

Clinton advocated an expanded role in global economic issues for the State Department, and cited the need for an increased U.S. diplomatic presence, especially in Iraq where the Defense Department had conducted diplomatic missions.[299] Clinton announced the most ambitious of her departmental reforms, the Quadrennial Diplomacy and Development Review, which establishes specific objectives for the State Department's diplomatic missions abroad; it was modeled after a similar process in the Defense Department that she was familiar with from her time on the Senate Armed Services Committee. The first such review was issued in late 2010 and called for the U.S. to lead through ""civilian power"".[301] and prioritize the empowerment of women throughout the world.[157] One cause that Clinton promoted throughout her tenure was the adoption of cookstoves in the developing world, to foster cleaner and more environmentally sound food preparation and reduce smoke dangers to women.[284]

Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov and Clinton holding a ""reset button"", 2009

In a 2009 internal Obama administration debate regarding the War in Afghanistan, Clinton sided with the military's recommendations for a maximal ""Afghanistan surge"", recommending 40,000 troops and no public deadline for withdrawal. She prevailed over Vice President Joe Biden's opposition but eventually supported Obama's compromise plan to send an additional 30,000 troops and tie the surge to a timetable for eventual withdrawal.[222]

In March 2009, Clinton presented Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov with a ""reset button"" symbolizing U.S. attempts to rebuild ties with that country under its new president, Dmitry Medvedev.[303] The policy, which became known as the Russian reset, led to improved cooperation in several areas during Medvedev's presidency.[303] However Clinton noted at the time that the US was concerned about Russia's use of energy as a tool of intimidation.[305] Bilateral relations, however, would decline considerably, after Medvedev's presidency ended in 2012 and Vladimir Putin's return to the Russian presidency.[306]

In October 2009, on a trip to Switzerland, Clinton's intervention overcame last-minute snafues and managed to secure the final signing of an historic Turkish–Armenian accord that established diplomatic relations and opened the border between the two long-hostile nations.[307][308] Beginning in 2010, she helped organize a diplomatic isolation and international sanctions regime against Iran, in an effort to force curtailment of that country's nuclear program; this eventually lead to the multinational Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action being agreed to in 2015.[284][309][310]

Clinton greeting service members at Andersen Air Force Base in 2010

In a prepared speech in January 2010, Clinton drew analogies between the Iron Curtain and the free and unfree Internet,[311] which marked the first time that a senior American government official had clearly defined the Internet as a key element of American foreign policy.[312]

In July 2010, she visited South Korea, where she and Cheryl Mills successfully worked to convince SAE-A, a large apparel subcontractor, to invest in Haiti despite the company's deep concerns about plans to raise the minimum wage.[313] This tied into the ""build back better"" program initiated by her husband after he was named the UN Special Envoy to Haiti in 2009 following a tropical storm season that caused $1 billion in damages to Haiti.[314]

The 2011 Egyptian protests posed the most challenging foreign policy crisis yet for the Obama administration.[315] Clinton's public response quickly evolved from an early assessment that the government of Hosni Mubarak was ""stable"", to a stance that there needed to be an ""orderly transition [to] a democratic participatory government"", to a condemnation of violence against the protesters.[316][317] Obama came to rely upon Clinton's advice, organization and personal connections in the behind-the-scenes response to developments.[315] As Arab Spring protests spread throughout the region, Clinton was at the forefront of a U.S. response that she recognized was sometimes contradictory, backing some regimes while supporting protesters against others.[318]

As the Libyan Civil War took place, Clinton's shift in favor of military intervention aligned her with Ambassador to the UN Susan Rice and National Security Council figure Samantha Power. This was a key turning point in overcoming internal administration opposition from Defense Secretary Gates, security advisor Thomas E. Donilon and counterterrorism advisor John Brennan in gaining the backing for, and Arab and U.N. approval of, the 2011 military intervention in Libya.[318][319][320] Secretary Clinton testified to Congress that the administration did not need congressional authorization for its military intervention in Libya, despite objections from some members of both parties that the administration was violating the War Powers Resolution. The State Department's legal advisor argued the same point when the Resolution's 60-day limit for unauthorized wars was passed (a view that prevailed in a legal debate within the Obama administration).[321] Clinton later used U.S. allies and what she called ""convening power"" to promote unity among the Libyan rebels as they eventually overthrew the Gaddafi regime.[319] The aftermath of the Libyan Civil War saw the country becoming a failed state.[322] The wisdom of the intervention and interpretation of what happened afterward would become the subject of considerable debate.[323][324][325]

During April 2011, internal deliberations of the president's innermost circle of advisors over whether to order U.S. special forces to conduct a raid into Pakistan against Osama bin Laden, Clinton was among those who argued in favor, saying the importance of getting bin Laden outweighed the risks to the U.S. relationship with Pakistan.[326] Following the completion of the mission on May 2 resulting in bin Laden's death, Clinton played a key role in the administration's decision not to release photographs of the dead al-Qaeda leader.[328] During internal discussions regarding Iraq in 2011, Clinton argued for keeping a residual force of up to 10,000–20,000 U.S. troops there. (All of them ended up being withdrawn after negotiations for a revised U.S.–Iraq Status of Forces Agreement failed.)[222][329]

Clinton with Aung San Suu Kyi during her 2011 visit to Myanmar

In a speech before the United Nations Human Rights Council in December 2011, Clinton said that, ""Gay rights are human rights"", and that the U.S. would advocate for gay rights and legal protections of gay people abroad. The same period saw her overcome internal administration opposition with a direct appeal to Obama and stage the first visit to Burma by a U.S. secretary of state since 1955. She met with Burmese leaders as well as opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi and sought to support the 2011 Burmese democratic reforms.[331] She also said the 21st century would be ""America's Pacific century"",[333] a declaration that was part of the Obama administration's ""pivot to Asia"".

During the Syrian Civil War, Clinton and the Obama administration initially sought to persuade Syrian president Bashar al-Assad to engage popular demonstrations with reform. As government violence allegedly rose in August 2011, they called for him to resign from the presidency. The administration joined several countries in delivering non-lethal assistance to so-called rebels opposed to the Assad government and humanitarian groups working in Syria.[336] During mid-2012, Clinton formed a plan with CIA Director David Petraeus to further strengthen the opposition by arming and training vetted groups of Syrian rebels. The proposal was rejected by White House officials who were reluctant to become entangled in the conflict, fearing that extremists hidden among the rebels might turn the weapons against other targets.[331]

In December 2012, Clinton was hospitalized for a few days for treatment of a blood clot in her right transverse venous sinus. Her doctors had discovered the clot during a follow-up examination for a concussion she had sustained when she fainted and fell nearly three weeks earlier, as a result of severe dehydration from a viral intestinal ailment acquired during a trip to Europe.[339] The clot, which caused no immediate neurological injury, was treated with anticoagulant medication, and her doctors have said she has made a full recovery.[339][340][l]

Overall themes

Clinton, along with members of the national security team, receive an update on Operation Neptune Spear in the White House Situation Room in 2011. Everyone in the room is watching a live feed from drones operating over the Osama bin Laden complex.

Throughout her time in office (and mentioned in her final speech concluding it), Clinton viewed ""smart power"" as the strategy for asserting U.S. leadership and values. In a world of varied threats, weakened central governments and increasingly important nongovernmental entities, smart power combined military hard power with diplomacy and U.S. soft power capacities in global economics, development aid, technology, creativity and human rights advocacy.[319][345] As such, she became the first secretary of state to methodically implement the smart power approach. In debates over use of military force, she was generally one of the more hawkish voices in the administration.[222][297][329] In August 2011 she hailed the ongoing multinational military intervention in Libya and the initial U.S. response towards the Syrian Civil War as examples of smart power in action.[347]

Clinton greatly expanded the State Department's use of social media, including Facebook and Twitter, to get its message out and to help empower citizens of foreign countries vis-à-vis their governments.[319] And in the Mideast turmoil, Clinton particularly saw an opportunity to advance one of the central themes of her tenure, the empowerment and welfare of women and girls worldwide.[157] Moreover, in a formulation that became known as the ""Hillary Doctrine"", she viewed women's rights as critical for U.S. security interests, due to a link between the level of violence against women and gender inequality within a state, and the instability and challenge to international security of that state.[295] In turn, there was a trend of women around the world finding more opportunities, and in some cases feeling safer, as the result of her actions and visibility.

Clinton visited 112 countries during her tenure, making her the most widely traveled secretary of state[350][m] (Time magazine wrote that ""Clinton's endurance is legendary"".)[319] The first secretary of state to visit countries like Togo and East Timor, she believed that in-person visits were more important than ever in the virtual age.[353] As early as March 2011, she indicated she was not interested in serving a second term as secretary of state should Obama be re-elected in 2012;[320] in December 2012, following that re-election, Obama nominated Senator John Kerry to be Clinton's successor.[339] Her last day as secretary of state was February 1, 2013.[354] Upon her departure, analysts commented that Clinton's tenure did not bring any signature diplomatic breakthroughs as some other secretaries of state had accomplished,[355][356] and highlighted her focus on goals she thought were less tangible but would have more lasting effect. She has also been criticized for accepting millions in dollars in donations from foreign governments to the Clinton Foundation during her tenure as Secretary of State.[358]

Benghazi attack and subsequent hearings

Obama and Clinton honor the Benghazi attack victims at the Transfer of Remains Ceremony, held at Andrews Air Force Base on September 14, 2012.

On September 11, 2012, the U.S. diplomatic mission in Benghazi, Libya, was attacked, resulting in the deaths of the U.S. Ambassador, J. Christopher Stevens and three other Americans. The attack, questions surrounding the security of the U.S. consulate, and the varying explanations given afterward by administration officials for what had happened became politically controversial in the U.S.[359] On October 15, Clinton took responsibility for the question of security lapses saying the differing explanations were due to the inevitable fog of war confusion after such events.[359][360]

On December 19, a panel led by Thomas R. Pickering and Michael Mullen issued its report on the matter. It was sharply critical of State Department officials in Washington for ignoring requests for more guards and safety upgrades and for failing to adapt security procedures to a deteriorating security environment.[361] It focused its criticism on the department's Bureau of Diplomatic Security and Bureau of Near Eastern Affairs; four State Department officials at the assistant secretary level and below were removed from their posts as a consequence.[362] Clinton said she accepted the conclusions of the report and that changes were underway to implement its suggested recommendations.[361]

Clinton gave testimony to two congressional foreign affairs committees on January 23, 2013, regarding the Benghazi attack. She defended her actions in response to the incident, and while still accepting formal responsibility, said she had had no direct role in specific discussions beforehand regarding consulate security.[363] Congressional Republicans challenged her on several points, to which she responded. In particular, after persistent questioning about whether or not the administration had issued inaccurate ""talking points"" after the attack, Clinton responded with the much-quoted rejoinder, ""With all due respect, the fact is we had four dead Americans. Was it because of a protest or was it because of guys out for a walk one night who decided that they'd they go kill some Americans? What difference at this point does it make? It is our job to figure out what happened and do everything we can to prevent it from ever happening again, Senator.""[363][364] In November 2014, the House Intelligence Committee issued a report that concluded there had been no wrongdoing in the administration's response to the attack.[365]

The Republican-led House Select Committee on Benghazi was created in May 2014 and conducted a two-year investigation related to the 2012 attack.[366] The committee was criticized as partisan,[366][367] including by one of its ex-staffers.[368] Some Republicans admitted that the committee aimed to lower Clinton's poll numbers.[369][370] On October 22, 2015, Clinton testified at an all-day and nighttime session before the committee.[371][372] Clinton was widely seen as emerging largely unscathed from the hearing, because of what the media perceived as a calm and unfazed demeanor and a lengthy, meandering, repetitive line of questioning from the committee.[373] The committee issued competing final reports in June 2016; the Republican report offered no evidence of culpability by Clinton.[367][366]

Email controversy

Clinton addressing the email controversy in 2015

During her tenure as secretary of state, Clinton conducted official business exclusively through her private email server, as opposed to her government email account. Some experts, officials, members of Congress and political opponents contended that her use of private messaging system software and a private server violated State Department protocols and procedures, and federal laws and regulations governing recordkeeping requirements. The controversy occurred against the backdrop of Clinton's 2016 presidential election campaign and hearings held by the House Select Committee on Benghazi.[375][376]

In a joint statement released on July 15, 2015, the inspector general of the State Department and the inspector general of the intelligence community said their review of the emails found information that was classified when sent, remained so at the time of their inspection and ""never should have been transmitted via an unclassified personal system"". They also stated unequivocally this classified information should never have been stored outside of secure government computer systems. Clinton had said over a period of months that she kept no classified information on the private server that she set up in her house.[377] Government policy, reiterated in the nondisclosure agreement signed by Clinton as part of gaining her security clearance, is that sensitive information can be considered as classified even if not marked as such.[378] After allegations were raised that some of the emails in question fell into the so-called ""born classified"" category, an FBI probe was initiated regarding how classified information was handled on the Clinton server.[379] The New York Times reported in February 2016 that nearly 2,100 emails stored on Clinton's server were retroactively marked classified by the State Department. Additionally, the intelligence community's inspector general wrote Congress to say that some of the emails ""contained classified State Department information when originated"".[380] In May 2016, the inspector general of the State Department criticized her use of a private email server while secretary of state, stating that she had not requested permission for this and would not have received it if she had asked.[381]

Clinton maintained she did not send or receive any emails from her personal server that were confidential at the time they were sent. In a Democratic debate with Bernie Sanders on February 4, 2016, Clinton said, ""I never sent or received any classified material—they are retroactively classifying it."" On July 2, 2016, Clinton stated: ""Let me repeat what I have repeated for many months now, I never received nor sent any material that was marked classified.""[382][383]

On July 5, 2016, the FBI concluded its investigation. In a statement, FBI director James Comey said:

110 e-mails in 52 e-mail chains have been determined by the owning agency to contain classified information at the time they were sent or received. Eight of those chains contained information that was Top Secret at the time they were sent; 36 chains contained Secret information at the time; and eight contained Confidential information, which is the lowest level of classification. Separate from those, about 2,000 additional e-mails were ""up-classified"" to make them Confidential; the information in those had not been classified at the time the e-mails were sent.[384][385]

Out of 30,000, three emails were found to be marked as classified, although they lacked classified headers and were marked only with a small ""c"" in parentheses, described as ""portion markings"" by Comey. He also said it was possible Clinton was not ""technically sophisticated"" enough to understand what the three classified markings meant.[385] The probe found Clinton used her personal email extensively while outside the United States, both sending and receiving work-related emails in the territory of sophisticated adversaries. Comey acknowledged that it was ""possible that hostile actors gained access to Secretary Clinton's personal email account"". He added that ""[although] we did not find clear evidence that Secretary Clinton or her colleagues intended to violate laws governing the handling of classified information, there is evidence that they were extremely careless in their handling of very sensitive, highly classified information"". Nevertheless, Comey asserted that ""no reasonable prosecutor"" would bring criminal charges in this case, despite the existence of ""potential violations of the statutes regarding the handling of classified information"". The FBI recommended that the Justice Department decline to prosecute.[384] On July 6, 2016, U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch confirmed that the probe into Clinton's use of private email servers would be closed without criminal charges.[386]

Two weeks before the election, on October 28, 2016, Comey notified Congress that the FBI had begun looking into newly discovered Clinton emails. On November 6, Comey notified Congress that the FBI had not changed the conclusion it had reached in July.[387] The notification was later cited by Clinton as a factor in her loss in the 2016 presidential election.[388] The emails controversy received more media coverage than any other topic during the 2016 presidential election.[389][390][391]

The State Department finished its internal review in September 2019. It found that Clinton's use of a personal email server increased the risk of information being compromised, but concluded there was no evidence of ""systemic, deliberate mishandling of classified information"".[392]

Clinton Foundation, Hard Choices, and speeches

Clinton in 2014

When Clinton left the State Department, she returned to private life for the first time in thirty years.[393] She and her daughter joined her husband as named members of the Bill, Hillary & Chelsea Clinton Foundation in 2013.[394] There she focused on early childhood development efforts, including an initiative called Too Small to Fail and a $600 million initiative to encourage the enrollment of girls in secondary schools worldwide, led by former Australian Prime Minister Julia Gillard.[394][395]

In 2014, Clinton published a second memoir, Hard Choices, which focused on her time as secretary of state. As of July 2015 , the book had sold about 280,000 copies.[396] Clinton also led the No Ceilings: The Full Participation Project, a partnership with the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation to gather and study data on the progress of women and girls around the world since the Beijing conference in 1995.[397] The foundation began accepting new donations from foreign governments, which it had stopped doing while she was secretary of state.[n] However, even though the Clinton Foundation had stopped taking donations from foreign governments, they continued to take large donations from foreign citizens who were sometimes linked to their governments.[400]

She began work on another volume of memoirs and made appearances on the paid speaking circuit.[401] There she received $200,000–225,000 per engagement, often appearing before Wall Street firms or at business conventions.[401][402] She also made some unpaid speeches on behalf of the foundation.[401] For the fifteen months ending in March 2015, Clinton earned over $11 million from her speeches.[403] For the overall period 2007–14, the Clintons earned almost $141 million, paid some $56 million in federal and state taxes and donated about $15 million to charity.[404] As of 2015 , she was estimated to be worth over $30 million on her own, or $45–53 million with her husband.[405]

Clinton resigned from the board of the Clinton Foundation in April 2015, when she began her presidential campaign. The foundation said it would accept new foreign governmental donations from six Western nations only.[n]

2016 presidential campaign

Clinton accepting Bernie Sanders' endorsement in 2016

On April 12, 2015, Clinton formally announced her candidacy for the presidency in the 2016 election.[406] She had a campaign-in-waiting already in place, including a large donor network, experienced operatives and the Ready for Hillary and Priorities USA Action political action committees and other infrastructure.[407] Prior to her campaign, Clinton had claimed in an interview on NDTV in May 2012 that she would not seek the presidency again, but later wrote in her 2014 autobiography Hard Choices that she had not decided.[408][409] The campaign's headquarters were established in the New York City borough of Brooklyn.[410] Her campaign focused on: raising middle class incomes, establishing universal preschool, making college more affordable and improving the Affordable Care Act.[411][412] Initially considered a prohibitive favorite to win the Democratic nomination,[406] Clinton faced an unexpectedly strong challenge from democratic socialist Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont. His longtime stance against the influence of corporations and the wealthy in American politics resonated with a dissatisfied citizenry troubled by the effects of income inequality in the U.S. and contrasted with Clinton's Wall Street ties.[402][412]

In the initial contest of the primaries season, Clinton only very narrowly won the Iowa Democratic caucuses, held February 1, over an increasingly popular Sanders[413][414] — the first woman to win them.[413] In the first primary, held in New Hampshire on February 9, she lost to Sanders by a wide margin.[415] Sanders was an increasing threat in the next contest, the Nevada caucuses on February 20,[416] but Clinton managed a five-percentage-point win, aided by final-days campaigning among casino workers.[417] Clinton followed that with a lopsided victory in the South Carolina primary on February 27.[416] These two victories stabilized her campaign and showed an avoidance of the management turmoil that harmed her 2008 effort.[416]

On March 1 Super Tuesday, Clinton won 7 of 11 contests, including a string of dominating victories across the South buoyed, as in South Carolina, by African-American voters. She opened up a significant lead in pledged delegates over Sanders.[418] She maintained this delegate lead across subsequent contests during the primary season, with a consistent pattern throughout. Sanders did better among younger, whiter, more rural and more liberal voters and states that held caucuses or where eligibility was open to independents. Clinton did better among older, black and Hispanic voter populations, and in states that held primaries or where eligibility was restricted to registered Democrats.[419][420][421]

By June 5, 2016, she had earned enough pledged delegates and supportive superdelegates for the media to consider her the presumptive nominee.[422] On June 7, after winning most of the states in the final major round of primaries, Clinton held a victory rally in Brooklyn becoming the first woman to claim the status of presumptive nominee for a major American political party.[423] By campaign's end, Clinton had won 2,219 pledged delegates to Sanders' 1,832; with an estimated 594 superdelegates compared to Sanders' 47.[424] She received almost 17 million votes during the nominating process, as opposed to Sanders' 13 million.[425]

Clinton was formally nominated at the 2016 Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia on July 26, 2016, becoming the first woman to be nominated for president by a major U.S. political party.[426] Her choice of vice presidential running mate, Senator Tim Kaine, was nominated by the convention the following day.[427] Her opponents in the general election included Republican Donald Trump, Libertarian Gary Johnson and Jill Stein of the Green Party. Around the time of the convention, WikiLeaks released emails that suggested the DNC and the Clinton campaign tilted the primary in Clinton's favor.[428]

Clinton held a significant lead in national polls over Trump throughout most of 2016. In early July, Trump and Clinton were tied in major polls following the FBI's conclusion of its investigation into her emails.[429][430] FBI Director James Comey concluded Clinton had been ""extremely careless"" in her handling of classified government material.[431] In late July, Trump gained his first lead over Clinton in major polls following a three to four percentage point convention bounce at the Republican National Convention. This was in line with the average bounce in conventions since 2004, although it was toward the low side by historical standards.[432][433][434] Following Clinton's seven percentage point convention bounce at the Democratic National Convention, she regained a significant lead in national polls at the start of August.[435][436] In fall 2016, Clinton and Tim Kaine published Stronger Together, which outlined their vision for the United States.[437]

Clinton delivering her concession speech

Clinton was defeated by Donald Trump in the November 8, 2016, presidential election.[438] By the early morning hours of November 9, Trump had received 279 projected electoral college votes, with 270 needed to win; media sources proclaimed him the winner.[439] Clinton then phoned Trump to concede and to congratulate him on his victory, whereupon Trump gave his victory speech.[440] The next morning Clinton made a public concession speech in which she acknowledged the pain of her loss, but called on her supporters to accept Trump as their next president, saying: ""We owe him an open mind and a chance to lead.""[441] Though Clinton lost the election by capturing only 232 electoral votes to Trump's 306, she won the popular vote by more than 2.8 million votes, or 2.1% of the voter base.[442][443] She is the fifth presidential candidate in U.S. history to win the popular vote but lose the election.[o][444][445] She won the most votes of any candidate who did not take office and the third-most votes of any candidate in history,[446][447] though she did not have the greatest percentage win of a losing candidate. (Andrew Jackson won the popular vote by 10.4% but lost to John Quincy Adams.)[448]

On December 19, 2016, when electors formally voted, Clinton lost five of her initial 232 votes due to faithless electors, with three of her Washington votes being cast instead for Colin Powell, one being cast for Faith Spotted Eagle, and one in Hawaii being cast for Bernie Sanders.[449]

Post–2016 election activities

The Clintons at Trump's inauguration in 2017

Clinton maintained a low profile in the months following her defeat in the 2016 presidential election.[450] She frequently engaged in nature walks in Chappaqua, with various sightings of Clinton circulating on social media.[451] On January 20, 2017, she attended the inauguration of Donald Trump.[452] On her decision to attend, Clinton stated: ""I'm here today to honor our democracy & its enduring values, I will never stop believing in our country & its future.""[453] Clinton also began work on a book of personal essays, in which she would reflect on her defeat in the election.[454] The book, What Happened, was released on September 12, 2017, alongside a picture book adaption of It Takes a Village.[455][456]

Clinton delivered a St. Patrick's Day speech in Scranton, Pennsylvania, on March 17, 2017. In it, alluding to reports that she had been seen taking walks in the woods around Chappaqua following her loss in the presidential election,[457][458] Clinton indicated her readiness to emerge from ""the woods"" and become politically active again.[457] However, the following month she confirmed she would not seek public office again.[459] She reiterated her comments in March 2019 and stated she would not run for president in 2020.[460]

In May 2017, Clinton announced the formation of Onward Together, a new political action committee that she wrote is ""dedicated to advancing the progressive vision that earned nearly 66 million votes in the last election"".[461] Clinton has also made occasional comments on political issues in the time since losing her presidential campaign,[462] and authored several op-eds.[463][464][465]

On April 28, 2020, Clinton endorsed the presumptive Democratic nominee, former Vice President Joe Biden, for president in the 2020 election[466] and she addressed the 2020 Democratic National Convention in August.[467] On July 21, 2024, Clinton endorsed Kamala Harris for president in the 2024 election.[468] On 19 August 2024, Clinton spoke at the 2024 Democratic National Convention. In her speech, she referenced the 34 felony convictions of Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, prompting chants of ""Lock him up!"" from the crowd in an ironic reference to Trump's own chants of ""Lock her up!"" in reference to Clinton's email scandal during his 2016 campaign.[469]

Since the election, Clinton has released several books. Clinton and her daughter Chelsea co-authored 2019's The Book of Gutsy Women and 2020's Grandma's Gardens.[470] On October 12, 2021, Clinton co-authored the fiction novel State of Terror with Louise Penny.[471] Clinton is set to release another memoir, Something Lost, Something Gained, on September 17, 2024.[472]

Clinton has also been involved in a number of media ventures. Clinton collaborated with director Nanette Burstein on the documentary film Hillary, which was released on Hulu in March 2020.[473] On September 29, 2020, Clinton launched an interview podcast in collaboration with iHeartRadio titled You and Me Both.[474] She has also produced television series, so far being a producer on the Apple TV+ series Gutsy[475] and the upcoming The CW adaption of The Woman's Hour.[476]

On January 2, 2020, it was announced that Clinton would take up the position of Chancellor at Queen's University Belfast. Clinton became the 11th and first female chancellor of the university, filling the position that had been vacant since 2018 after the death of her predecessor, Thomas J. Moran.[477][478] In January 2023, Columbia University announced that Clinton would join the university as professor of practice at the School of International and Public Affairs and as a presidential fellow at Columbia World Projects.[479]

Political positions

Using her Senate votes, several organizations have attempted to measure Clinton's place on the political spectrum scientifically. National Journal's 2004 study of roll-call votes assigned Clinton a rating of 30 on the political spectrum, relative to the Senate at the time, with a rating of 1 being most liberal and 100 being most conservative.[480] National Journal's subsequent rankings placed her as the 32nd-most liberal senator in 2006 and 16th-most liberal senator in 2007.[481] A 2004 analysis by political scientists Joshua D. Clinton of Princeton University and Simon Jackman and Doug Rivers of Stanford University found her likely to be the sixth-to-eighth-most liberal senator.[482] The Almanac of American Politics, edited by Michael Barone and Richard E. Cohen, rated her votes from 2003 through 2006 as liberal on economics, social issues, and foreign policy.[p] According to FiveThirtyEight's measure of political ideology, ""Clinton was one of the most liberal members during her time in the Senate.""[483]

Organizations have also attempted to provide more recent assessments of Clinton after she reentered elective politics in 2015. Based on her stated positions from the 1990s to the present, On the Issues places her in the ""Left Liberal"" region on their two-dimensional grid of social and economic ideologies, with a social score of 80 on a scale of zero more-restrictive to 100 less-government stances, with an economic score of ten on a scale of zero more-restrictive to 100 less-government stances.[484] Crowdpac, which does a data aggregation of campaign contributions, votes and speeches, gives her a 6.5L rating on a one-dimensional left-right scale from 10L (most liberal) to 10C (most conservative).[485]

Economics

In March 2016, Clinton laid out a detailed economic plan, which The New York Times called ""optimistic"" and ""wide-ranging"". Basing her economic philosophy on inclusive capitalism, Clinton proposed a ""clawback"" that would rescind tax relief and other benefits for companies that move jobs overseas; providing incentives for companies that share profits with employees, communities and the environment, rather than focusing on short-term profits to increase stock value and rewarding shareholders; increasing collective bargaining rights; and placing an ""exit tax"" on companies that move their headquarters out of America to pay a lower tax rate overseas.[486]

Domestic policy

Clinton accepts the scientific consensus on climate change and supports cap-and-trade,[487] and opposed the Keystone XL pipeline.[488] She supported ""equal pay for equal work"", to address current shortfalls in how much women are paid to do the same jobs men do.[489] Clinton has explicitly focused on family issues and supports universal preschool.[490] These programs would be funded by proposing tax increases on the wealthy, including a ""fair share surcharge"".[491] Clinton supported the Affordable Care Act[492] and would have added a ""public option"" that competed with private insurers and enabled people ""50 or 55 and up"" to buy into Medicare.[493][494]

LGBT rights

Clinton supports the right to same-sex marriage, a position that has developed throughout her political career.[490] In 2000, she was against such marriages altogether. In 2006, she said only that she would support a state's decision to permit same-sex marriages, but opposed federally amending the Constitution to permit same-sex marriage. While running for president in 2007, she again reiterated her opposition to same-sex marriage, although she expressed her support of civil unions.[495][496] 2013 marked the first time that Clinton expressed support for a national right to same-sex marriage.[496] In 2016, she was the first major-party presidential candidate ever to write an op-ed for an LGBT newspaper, the Philadelphia Gay News.[497]

Immigration

Clinton held that allowing undocumented immigrants to have a path to citizenship ""[i]s at its heart a family issue"",[498] and expressed support for Obama's Deferred Action for Parental Accountability (DAPA) program, which would allow up to five million undocumented immigrants to gain deferral of deportation and authorization to legally work in the United States.[499][500] However, in 2014, Clinton stated that unaccompanied children crossing the border ""should be sent back"".[501] She opposed and criticized Trump's call to temporarily ban Muslims from entering the United States.[502]

Foreign policy

On foreign affairs, Clinton voted in favor of the Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Iraq in October 2002,[503] a vote she later said she regretted.[504] She favored arming Syria's rebel fighters in 2012 and has called for the removal of Syrian president Bashar al-Assad.[505] She supported the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia in 1999 and the NATO-led military intervention in Libya to oust former Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi in 2011.[506][507] Clinton is in favor of maintaining American influence in the Middle East.[502] She has told the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, ""America can't ever be neutral when it comes to Israel's security and survival.""[508] Clinton expressed support for Israel's right to defend itself during the 2006 Lebanon War and 2014 Israel–Gaza conflict.[509][510] In a 2017 interview, after a poison gas attack in Syria, Clinton said that she had favored more aggressive action against Bashar al-Assad: ""I think we should have been more willing to confront Assad. I really believe we should have and still should take out his air fields and prevent him from being able to use them to bomb innocent people and drop sarin gas on them.""[511] Clinton opposed a ceasefire in the 2023 Israel–Hamas war,[512] stating ""Remember, there was a ceasefire on October 6, that Hamas broke by their barbaric assault on peaceful civilians.""[513]

Religious views

Clinton has been a lifelong Methodist, and has been part of United Methodist Church congregations throughout her life. She has publicly discussed her Christian faith on several occasions, although seldom while campaigning.[514][515] Professor Paul Kengor, author of God and Hillary Clinton: A Spiritual Life, has suggested that Clinton's political positions are rooted in her faith. She often expresses a maxim often attributed to John Wesley: ""Do all the good you can, by all the means you can, in all the ways you can.""[514]

Cultural and political image

Clinton worked at Rose Law Firm for fifteen years. Her professional career and political involvement set the stage for public reaction to her as the first lady.

Over a hundred books and scholarly works have been written about Clinton. A 2006 survey by the New York Observer found ""a virtual cottage industry"" of ""anti-Clinton literature"" put out by Regnery Publishing and other conservative imprints. Some titles include Madame Hillary: The Dark Road to the White House, Hillary's Scheme: Inside the Next Clinton's Ruthless Agenda to Take the White House and Can She Be Stopped?: Hillary Clinton Will Be the Next President of the United States Unless ... Books praising Clinton did not sell nearly as well[516] (other than her memoirs and those of her husband). When she ran for Senate in 2000, several fundraising groups such as Save Our Senate and the Emergency Committee to Stop Hillary Rodham Clinton sprang up to oppose her.[517] Don Van Natta found that Republican and conservative groups viewed her as a reliable ""bogeyman"" to mention in fundraising letters, on a par with Ted Kennedy, and the equivalent of Democratic and liberal appeals mentioning Newt Gingrich.[518]

Clinton has also been featured in the media and popular culture in a wide spectrum of perspectives. In 1995, writer Todd S. Purdum of The New York Times characterized Clinton as a Rorschach test,[519] an assessment echoed at the time by feminist writer and activist Betty Friedan, who said, ""Coverage of Hillary Clinton is a massive Rorschach test of the evolution of women in our society.""[520] She has been the subject of many satirical impressions on Saturday Night Live, beginning with her time as the first lady. She has made guest appearances on the show herself, in 2008 and in 2015, to face-off with her doppelgängers.[521][522]

Clinton in 2015

She has often been described in the popular media as a polarizing figure, though some argue otherwise.[523] In the early stages of her 2008 presidential campaign, a Time magazine cover showed a large picture of her with two checkboxes labeled ""Love Her"", ""Hate Her"".[524] Mother Jones titled its profile of her ""Harpy, Hero, Heretic: Hillary"".[525] Following Clinton's ""choked up moment"" and related incidents in the run-up to the January 2008 New Hampshire primary, both The New York Times and Newsweek found that discussion of gender's role in the campaign had moved into the national political discourse.[526][527] Newsweek editor Jon Meacham summed up the relationship between Clinton and the American public by saying the New Hampshire events, ""brought an odd truth to light: though Hillary Rodham Clinton has been on the periphery or in the middle of national life for decades ... she is one of the most recognizable but least understood figures in American politics"".[527]

Once she became secretary of state, Clinton's image seemed to improve dramatically among the American public and become one of a respected world figure.[295][528] Her favorability ratings dropped, however, after she left office and began to be viewed in the context of partisan politics once more.[529] By September 2015, with her 2016 presidential campaign underway and beset by continued reports regarding her private email usage at the State Department, her ratings had slumped to some of her lowest levels ever.[530] In March 2016, she acknowledged that: ""I'm not a natural politician, in case you haven't noticed.""[531]

Honors and recognition

In January 2025, United States President Joe Biden awarded Hillary Clinton the Presidential Medal of Freedom.[532]

Hillary Rodham Clinton has spent five decades in public service as an advocate, attorney, First Lady, U.S. Senator, U.S. Secretary of State, and presidential candidate.

Hillary Rodham was born in Chicago, Illinois on October 26, 1947. After graduating from Wellesley College and Yale Law School, she began her life-long work on behalf of children and families by joining the Children’s Defense Fund. In 1974, she moved to Arkansas, where she married Bill Clinton and became a successful attorney while also raising their daughter, Chelsea. During her 12 years as First Lady of Arkansas, she was Chairwoman of the Arkansas Education Standards Committee, co-founded the Arkansas Advocates for Children and Families, and served on the boards of the Arkansas Children’s Hospital, and the Children’s Defense Fund.

As First Lady of the United States, from 1993 to 2001, Hillary Clinton championed health care for all Americans and led successful bipartisan efforts to improve the adoption and foster care systems, reduce teen pregnancy, and create the Children’s Health Insurance Program. She traveled to more than 80 countries standing up for human rights, democracy, and civil society. Her speech in Beijing in 1995 – where she declared that “human rights are women’s rights, and women’s rights are human rights” – inspired women worldwide and helped galvanize a global movement for women’s rights and opportunities.

In 2000, Clinton made history as the first First Lady elected to the United States Senate, and the first woman elected to statewide office in New York. As Senator, she worked across party lines to expand economic opportunity and access to quality, affordable health care. After the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, she secured funding to rebuild New York and provide health care for first responders who risked their lives working at Ground Zero. She also championed the cause of our nation’s military and fought for better health care and benefits for wounded service members, veterans, and members of the National Guard and Reserves. In 2006, Clinton was reelected to the Senate, winning 58 out of New York’s 62 counties.

In 2007, she began her first historic campaign for president, winning 18 million votes and becoming the first woman to ever win a presidential primary or caucus state. In the 2008 general election, she campaigned for Barack Obama and Joe Biden, and in December, she was nominated by President-elect Obama to be Secretary of State.

In her four years as America’s chief diplomat and the President’s principal foreign policy adviser, Clinton played a central role in restoring America’s standing in the world and strengthening its global leadership, visiting 112 countries over 4 years, restoring America’s standing in the world. Her “smart power” approach to foreign policy elevated American diplomacy and development and repositioned them for the 21st century – with new tools, technologies, and partners, including the private sector and civil society around the world. She led the effort to impose crippling sanctions on Iran, laying the foundation for a historic agreement to curb its nuclear program, and negotiated a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas that prevented a new war in the Middle East. Across the world, she defended universal values and pushed the frontiers of human rights.

In 2016, Clinton made history again by becoming the first woman nominated for president by a major U.S. political party. As the Democratic candidate for president, she campaigned on a vision of America that is “stronger together” and an agenda to make our economy work for everyone, not just those at the top. She won the national popular vote, earning the support of nearly 66 million Americans.

Since leaving civil service and electoral politics, Clinton has remained an active force for progress and human rights. In recent years, she has leant her decades of experience to nurturing the next generation of leaders. Clinton serves as the 11th and first female Chancellor of Queen’s University Belfast, reflecting a long history with the region – as First Lady, Clinton advocated for the women activists who were instrumental in the peace agreement that ended the Troubles and she has maintained a deep connection to Belfast and Northern Ireland. In 2023, Clinton went back to the classroom when she joined Columbia University as a co-founder of the Institute of Global Politics and Professor of Practice at the School of International and Public Affairs (SIPA). She teaches a course with Dean Keren Yarhi-Milo called Inside the Situation Room, which engages young scholars with insights from diverse academic fields and the direct experience of high level diplomats, journalists, and other experts.

Her commitment to the stories we tell ourselves about who we are as Americans and what kind of future we want for our children and our grandchildren extends to her work as an author, podcast host, and television and Broadway producer. Clinton is the author of eleven best-selling books, including her groundbreaking book on children, It Takes A Village (1996); Dear Socks, Dear Buddy (1998); An Invitation to the White House (2000); her memoirs, Living History (2003), Hard Choices (2014), and What Happened (2017); a picture book edition of It Takes a Village (2017); The Book of Gutsy Women (2019) and Grandma’s Gardens (2020), in collaboration with Chelsea Clinton; and her political thriller, State of Terror (2021), with Louise Penny; and Something Lost, Something Gained: Reflections on Life, Love, and Liberty (2024). Her podcast, You and Me Both, features candid, in-depth, and sometimes hilarious conversations with actors, activists, and other people who have unique perspectives on the challenges and joys of modern life. Clinton is the founder of HiddenLight Productions, a global studio dedicated to bringing the stories of inspiring individuals and movements to TV, film, and streaming. The studio’s projects include Gutsy, a television adaptation of The Book of Gutsy Women, in which Hillary and Chelsea Clinton interview remarkable women in all walks of life.

In 2024, Clinton produced her first Broadway show, SUFFS, a love letter to the complicated women who fought for the right to vote and for a future they would never see but knew was possible. The musical was nominated for six Tony Awards, including Best Musical, and won two Tony Awards for Best Book of a Musical and Best Original Score.

She and President Clinton reside in New York. They have one daughter, Chelsea, and are the proud grandparents of Charlotte, Aidan, and Jasper."
Hillary Clinton,United States,en,https://www.whitehousehistory.org/bios/hillary-clinton,"During the 1992 presidential campaign, Hillary Rodham Clinton observed, “Our lives are a mixture of different roles. Most of us are doing the best we can to find whatever the right balance is....For me, that balance is family, work, and service.”

Hillary Diane Rodham, Dorothy and Hugh Rodham’s first child, was born in Chicago on October 26, 1947, and raised in suburban Park Ridge, Illinois. Life for the Rodhams was comfortable, centered in family, friends, school, and the Methodist church. Hillary’s parents expected her to study hard, and she was a student leader in high school. After a youth minister took her to hear Martin Luther King Jr. speak in Chicago, she began to have a wider view of the world.

As an undergraduate at Wellesley College, Hillary combined academic excellence with service in student government. Speaking at graduation, she told her classmates, “The challenge now is to practice politics as the art of making what appears to be impossible, possible.” She enrolled in Yale Law School, where she served on the Board of Editors of the Yale Review of Law and Social Action, interned with children’s advocate Marian Wright Edelman, and met William Jefferson Clinton.

After graduation, Hillary Rodham advised the Children’s Defense Fund in Cambridge and joined the impeachment inquiry staff advising the Judiciary Committee of the House of Representatives. Then she “followed her heart to Arkansas,” where Bill had begun his political career. They married on October 11, 1975. She joined the faculty of the University of Arkansas Law School, and in 1978, President Jimmy Carter appointed her to the board of the Legal Services Corporation. Bill Clinton was elected governor of Arkansas, and in 1980 their daughter, Chelsea, was born. For twelve years, as Arkansas’s ﬁrst lady, Hillary balanced family, law, and public service. Then Bill was elected president.

As the nation’s ﬁrst lady, Mrs. Clinton chaired the Task Force on National Health Care Reform. Never before had a ﬁrst lady been so directly involved in public policy. She led the fight to pass the Children’s Health Insurance Program; worked to increase funding for research and treatment of cancer, AIDS, osteoporosis, and juvenile diabetes; chaired Save America’s Treasures; and supported gun control efforts. She wrote two best-selling books and won a Grammy award for her recording of It Takes a Village and Other Lessons Children Teach Us.

In 2000 Hillary was elected senator from New York, and her work in health, education, aging, and the environment gained her national reputation in her own right. In 2007 she ran for president. After a hard-fought primary she lost the Democratic nomination to Barack Obama but quickly supported his candidacy. When he was elected, he named her secretary of state. For four years Hillary traveled the world on behalf of U.S. interests.

In 2015 Hillary Clinton launched her second presidential campaign and in July 2016 became the first woman in American history to receive the presidential nomination of a major political party. That fall, she received more than 65 million votes but ultimately lost the Electoral Collect to Republican nominee Donald J. Trump."
Hillary Clinton,United States,en,https://www.womenshistory.org/education-resources/biographies/hillary-clinton,"In July of 2016, Hillary Rodham Clinton became the first woman in history to represent a major party in a United States presidential election. She is also the first woman to win the Iowa Presidential Caucus, the first First Lady elected to the United States Senate, and the first female senator from New York.

Hillary Diane Rodham was born in a suburb outside of Chicago, Illinois in 1947 to middle-class parents. They encouraged her to take education seriously, and she earned entrance to Massachusetts’ Wellesley College. Her parents were Republicans and Clinton served as president of Wellesley’s Republican club, but the social issues of the late 1960s led her to become a dedicated Democrat. When her classmates elected her as Wellesley’s first student speaker at graduation, she said to her peers: “The challenge now is to practice politics as the art of making what appears to be impossible, possible.”

In 1969, Clinton attended Yale Law School, where she served on the Board of Editors for the Yale Review of Law and Social Action. It was there that Clinton met her future husband, William “Bill” Clinton. After she graduated, Clinton turned down offers from lucrative law firms to work for the Children’s Defense Fund, as well as on the congressional committee that investigated the Watergate scandal.

Clinton then moved to the university town of Fayetteville, Arkansas, where she joined the faculty of the University of Arkansas Law School. In 1975 she and Bill Clinton were married. The following year, Clinton joined the Rose Law Firm in Little Rock. The couple’s daughter, Chelsea, was born in 1980. In 1988 and 1991, Clinton was named one of the 100 most influential lawyers in America.

Clinton continued to practice law after Bill Clinton became governor of Arkansas, while also serving as a very active first lady. She led the Arkansas Educational Standards Committee, which greatly improved schools, and promoted programs that benefit women.

In 1992, when Bill Clinton was elected president, Clinton became the first First Lady to hold a law degree. She continued her tradition of public service, most notably leading an attempt to reform the nation’s health care. However, the effort failed in the mid-1990s. Clinton continued to work on the edges of the issue, helping to establish the 1997 Children's Health Insurance Program.

Clinton constantly traveled during her time as First Lady. She often took her daughter along when she visited women in Africa and Asia, and in 1995, she was criticized for joining the American delegation to Beijing for the United Nation’s conference on women’s rights. This convocation had been held every five years since 1975, but no first lady had attended it.

Clinton ran in 2000 for the New York Senate seat being vacated by Daniel Monahan, who supported her. Many accused her of being a “carpetbagger” because she had never lived in New York, but voters chose her by a solid 55% majority. She served on four major Senate committees: Armed Services; Budget; Environment and Public Works; and Health, Education, Labor and Pensions. New Yorkers gained confidence in her, and Clinton easily won her 2006 reelection.

On January 20, 2007, Clinton announced her candidacy for president and joined the historic 2008 race. Although Clinton received roughly 18 million votes, she lost in the Democratic Primary to Senator Barack Obama, who went on to win the presidency. Clinton served as secretary of state for the Obama administration from 2009-2013. During this time, Clinton focused on women and human rights.

On April 12, 2015, Clinton announced her second run for the Democratic presidential nomination. Vermont's Independent Senator, Bernie Sanders, mounted an unexpectedly strong challenge. In July of 2016, Clinton secured the nomination at the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia and became the first woman in history to represent a major party in a U.S. presidential election. Though she won the popular vote 48.2% to 46.1%, she lost the presidential race to her Republican opponent, Donald Trump, in the Electoral College."
Hillary Clinton,United States,en,https://clintonhousemuseum.org/hillary-clinton/,"Secretary Hillary Rodham Clinton was born on October 26, 1947 in Chicago and spent her childhood in Park Ridge, Illinois, a Chicago suburb. She is the eldest daughter of Hugh Rodham and Dorothy Howell Rodham. Clinton has two younger brothers, Hugh, Jr. and Anthony.

Hillary Rodham engaged in politics early. As a preteen in 1960, she canvassed for Richard Nixon in Chicago. When she was fourteen in 1962, she saw the Reverend Martin Luther King, Jr. speak in Chicago on a youth group trip. His speech inspired her to be a public servant. Her high school history teacher encouraged her early conservative ideals, and in 1964 she campaigned for Republican candidate Barry Goldwater in the presidential campaign.

Rodham attended Wellesley College, an all-female college near Boston, Massachusetts, from 1965 to 1969. She participated in student politics and served as president of the Young Republicans Club. Rodham changed her political outlook after witnessing Vietnam War protests, Civil Rights riots, the struggle of her black classmates and the assassinations of Martin Luther King, Jr. and Robert Kennedy. By the end of her undergraduate career, she identified as a Democrat."
